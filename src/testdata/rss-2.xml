            <description>&lt;p&gt;I needed a bit of a break from &amp;ldquo;real work&amp;rdquo;
                recently, so I started a new
                programming project that was low-stakes and purely recreational. On April 21st,
                I set out to see how much of a Unix-like operating system for x86_64 targets
                that I could put together in about a month. The result is
                &lt;a href="https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/bunnix"&gt;Bunnix&lt;/a&gt;. Not including
                days I didn&amp;rsquo;t work
                on Bunnix for one reason or another, I spent 27 days on this project.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a little demo of the results&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;iframe title="A short demo of the Bunnix operating system" width="720"
                height="400"
                src="https://spacepub.space/videos/embed/415822ac-5755-42a4-9081-b48639eed6be"
                frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts
                allow-popups"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;You can try it for yourself if you like:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://cyanide.ayaya.dev/bunnix.iso"&gt;Bunnix 0.0.0
                iso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To boot this ISO with qemu:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;pre tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code&gt;qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom bunnix.iso -display
                sdl -serial stdio
                &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also write the iso to a USB stick and boot
                it on real hardware. It will
                probably work on most AMD64 machines &amp;ndash; I have tested it on a ThinkPad X220
                and
                a Starlabs Starbook Mk IV. Legacy boot and EFI are both supported. There are
                some limitations to keep in mind, in particular that there is no USB support, so
                a PS/2 keyboard (or PS/2 emulation via the BIOS) is required. Most laptops rig
                up the keyboard via PS/2, and &lt;abbr title="your milage may
                vary"&gt;YMMV&lt;/abbr&gt;
                with USB keyboards via PS/2 emulation.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tip: the DOOM keybindings are weird. WASD to move, right shift to
                shoot, and
                space to open doors. Exiting the game doesn&amp;rsquo;t work so just reboot when
                you&amp;rsquo;re
                done playing. I confess I didn&amp;rsquo;t spend much time on that
                port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="whats-there"&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s there?&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Bunnix kernel is (mostly) written in &lt;a
                href="https://harelang.org"&gt;Hare&lt;/a&gt;, plus some
                C components, namely lwext4 for ext4 filesystem support and libvterm for the
                kernel video terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The kernel supports the following drivers:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;PCI (legacy)&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;AHCI block devices&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;GPT and MBR partition tables&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;PS/2 keyboards&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Platform serial ports&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;CMOS clocks&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Framebuffers (configured by the bootloaders)&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;ext4 and memfs filesystems&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;There are numerous supported kernel features as well:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;A virtual filesystem&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;A /dev populated with block devices, null, zero, and full psuedo-devices,
                /dev/kbd and /dev/fb0, serial and video TTYs, and the /dev/tty controlling
                terminal.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Reasonably complete terminal emulator and somewhat passable termios
                support&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Some 40 syscalls, including for example clock_gettime, poll, openat et al,
                fork, exec, pipe, dup, dup2, ioctl, etc&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Bunnix is a single-user system and does not currently attempt to enforce
                Unix
                file modes and ownership, though it could be made multi-user relatively easily
                with a few more days of work.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Included are two bootloaders, one for legacy boot which is
                multiboot-compatible
                and written in Hare, and another for EFI which is written in C. Both of them
                load the kernel as an ELF file plus an initramfs, if required. The EFI
                bootloader includes zlib to decompress the initramfs; multiboot-compatible
                bootloaders handle this decompression for us.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The userspace is largely assembled from third-party sources. The following
                third-party software is included:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Colossal Cave Adventure (advent)&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;dash (/bin/sh)&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Doom&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;gzip&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;less (pager)&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;lok (/bin/awk)&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;lolcat&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;mandoc (man pages)&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;sbase (core utils)&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1"
                class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;tcc (C compiler)&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Vim 5.7&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The libc is derived from musl libc and contains numerous modifications to
                suit
                Bunnix&amp;rsquo;s needs. The curses library is based on netbsd-curses.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The system works but it&amp;rsquo;s pretty buggy and some parts of it are
                quite slapdash:
                your milage will vary. Be prepared for it to crash!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="how-bunnix-came-together"&gt;How Bunnix came together&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I started documenting the process on Mastodon on day 3 &amp;ndash; check
                out &lt;a href="https://fosstodon.org/@drewdevault/112319697309218275"&gt;the
                Mastodon thread&lt;/a&gt; for the
                full story. Here&amp;rsquo;s what it looked like on day 3:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;img
                src="https://cdn.fosstodon.org/media_attachments/files/112/319/693/110/194/041/original/2c0bd7006a74aece.png"
                alt="Screenshot of an early Bunnix build, which boots up, sets up available memory,
                and exercises an early in-memory filesystem"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s some thoughts after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Some of Bunnix&amp;rsquo;s code stems from an earlier project,
                &lt;a href="https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/helios"&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt;. This includes
                portions of the kernel
                which are responsible for some relatively generic CPU setup (GDT, IDT, etc), and
                some drivers like AHCI were adapted for the Bunnix system. I admit that it would
                probably not have been possible to build Bunnix so quickly without prior
                experience through Helios.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Two of the more challenging aspects were ext4 support and the virtual
                terminal,
                for which I brought in two external dependencies, lwext4 and libvterm. Both
                proved to be challenging integrations. I had to rewrite my filesystem layer a
                few times, and it&amp;rsquo;s still buggy today, but getting a proper Unix
                filesystem
                design (including openat and good handling of inodes) requires digging into
                lwext4 internals a bit more than I&amp;rsquo;d have liked. I also learned a lot
                about
                mixing source languages into a Hare project, since the kernel links together
                Hare, assembly, and C sources &amp;ndash; it works remarkably well but there are
                some
                pain points I noticed, particularly with respect to building the ABI integration
                riggings. It&amp;rsquo;d be nice to automate conversion of C headers into Hare
                forward
                declaration modules. Some of this work already exists in hare-c, but has a ways
                to go. If I were to start again, I would probably be more careful in my design
                of the filesystem layer.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Getting the terminal right was difficult as well. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure
                that I was going
                to add one at all, but I eventually decided that I wanted to port vim and that
                was that. libvterm is a great terminal state machine library, but it&amp;rsquo;s
                poorly
                documented and required a lot of fine-tuning to integrate just right. I also
                ended up spending a lot of time on performance to make sure that the terminal
                worked smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Another difficult part to get right was the scheduler. Helios has a simpler
                scheduler than Bunnix, and while I initially based the Bunnix scheduler on
                Helios I had to throw out and rewrite quite a lot of it. Both Helios and Bunnix
                are single-CPU systems, but unlike Helios, Bunnix allows context switching
                within the kernel &amp;ndash; in fact, even preemptive task switching enters and
                exits
                via the kernel. This necessitates multiple kernel stacks and a different
                approach to task switching. However, the advantages are numerous, one of which
                being that implementing blocking operations like disk reads and pipe(2) are much
                simpler with wait queues. With a robust enough scheduler, the rest of the kernel
                and its drivers come together pretty easily.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Another source of frustration was signals, of course. Helios does not
                attempt to
                be a Unix and gets away without these, but to build a Unix, I needed to
                implement signals, big messy hack though they may be. The signal implementation
                which ended up in Bunnix is pretty bare-bones: I mostly made sure that SIGCHLD
                worked correctly so that I could port dash.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Porting third-party software was relatively easy thanks to basing my libc
                on
                musl libc. I imported large swaths of musl into my own libc and adapted it to
                run on Bunnix, which gave me a pretty comprehensive and reliable C library
                pretty fast. With this in place, porting third-party software was a breeze, and
                most of the software that&amp;rsquo;s included was built with minimal
                patching.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="what-i-learned"&gt;What I learned&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Bunnix was an interesting project to work on. My other project, Helios, is
                a
                microkernel design that&amp;rsquo;s Not Unix, while Bunnix is a monolithic kernel
                that is
                much, much closer to Unix.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;One thing I was surprised to learn a lot about is filesystems. Helios, as a
                microkernel, spreads the filesystem implementation across many drivers running
                in many separate processes. This works well enough, but one thing I discovered
                is that it&amp;rsquo;s quite important to have caching in the filesystem layer, even
                if
                only to track living objects. When I revisit Helios, I will have a lot of work
                to do refactoring (or even rewriting) the filesystem code to this end.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The approach to drivers is also, naturally, much simpler in a monolithic
                kernel
                design, though I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely pleased with all of the stuff I heaped
                into ring
                0. There might be room for an improved Helios scheduler design that incorporates
                some of the desirable control flow elements from the monolithic design into a
                microkernel system.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I also finally learned how signals work from top to bottom, and boy is it
                ugly.
                I&amp;rsquo;ve always felt that this was one of the weakest points in the design of
                Unix
                and this project did nothing to disabuse me of that notion.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I had also tried to avoid using a bitmap allocator in Helios, and generally
                memory management in Helios is a bit fussy altogether &amp;ndash; one of the biggest
                pain
                points with the system right now. However, Bunnix uses a simple bitmap allocator
                for all conventional pages on the system and I found that it works really,
                really well and does not have nearly as much overhead as I had feared it would.
                I will almost certainly take those lessons back to Helios.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Finally, I&amp;rsquo;m quite sure that putting together Bunnix in just 30
                days is a feat
                which would not have been possible with a microkernel design. At the end of the
                day, monolithic kernels are just much simpler to implement. The advantages of a
                microkernel design are compelling, however &amp;ndash; perhaps a better answer lies
                in a
                hybrid kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2 id="whats-next"&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s next&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Bunnix was (note the past tense) a project that I wrote for the purpose of
                recreational programming, so it&amp;rsquo;s purpose is to be fun to work on. And
                I&amp;rsquo;ve had
                my fun! At this point I don&amp;rsquo;t feel the need to invest more time and energy
                into
                it, though it would definitely benefit from some. In the future I may spend a
                few days on it here and there, and I would be happy to integrate improvements
                from the community &amp;ndash; send patches to my &lt;a
                href="https://lists.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/public-inbox"&gt;public inbox&lt;/a&gt;. But for
                the most
                part it is an art project which is now more-or-less complete.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;My next steps in OS development will be a return to Helios with a lot of
                lessons
                learned and some major redesigns in the pipeline. But I still think that Bunnix
                is a fun and interesting OS in its own right, in no small part due to its
                demonstration of Hare as a great language for kernel hacking. Some of the
                priorities for improvements include:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;A directory cache for the filesystem and better caching
                generally&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Ironing out ext4 bugs&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;procfs and top&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;mmaping files&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;More signals (e.g. SIGSEGV)&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Multi-user support&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;NVMe block devices&lt;/li&gt;

            <guid>https://drewdevault.com/2024/04/19/2024-04-19-Copyleft-is-not-restrictive.html</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;One may observe an axis, or a &amp;ldquo;spectrum&amp;rdquo;,
                along which free and open source
                software licenses can be organized, where one end is
                &amp;ldquo;permissive&amp;rdquo; and the other
                end is &amp;ldquo;copyleft&amp;rdquo;. It is important to acknowledge, however, that
                though copyleft
                can be found at the opposite end of an axis with respect to permissive, it is
                not synonymous with the linguistic antonym of permissive &amp;ndash; that is,
                copyleft
                licenses are not &amp;ldquo;restrictive&amp;rdquo; by comparison with permissive
                licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aside: Free software is not synonymous with copyleft and open
                source is not
                synonymous with permissive, though this is a common misconception. Permissive
                licenses are generally free software and copyleft licenses are generally open
                source; the distinction between permissive and copyleft is orthogonal to the
                distinction between free software and open source.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It is a common misunderstanding to construe copyleft licenses as more
                &amp;ldquo;restrictive&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;less free&amp;rdquo; than permissive
                licenses. This view is predicated
                on a shallow understanding of freedom, a sort of passive freedom that presents
                as the absence of obligations. Copyleft is predicated on a deeper understanding
                of freedom in which freedom is a &lt;em&gt;positive guarantee of
                rights&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a
                href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberty-positive-negative/"&gt;[source]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s consider the matter of freedom, obligation, rights, and
                restrictions in
                depth.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Both forms of licenses include obligations, which are not the same thing as
                restrictions. An example of an obligation can be found in the permissive MIT
                license:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Permission is hereby granted […] to deal in the Software without
                restriction
                […] subject to the following conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in
                all
                copies or substantial portions of the Software.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This obliges the user, when distributing copies of the software, to include
                the
                copyright notice. However, it does not &lt;em&gt;restrict&lt;/em&gt; the use of the
                software under
                any conditions. An example of a restriction comes from the infamous JSON
                license, which adds the following clause to a stock MIT license:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;IBM famously petitioned Douglas Crockford for, and received, a license to
                do
                evil with JSON.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref"
                role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This kind of clause is broadly
                referred to in the free
                software jargon as &amp;ldquo;discrimination against field of endeavour&amp;rdquo;,
                and such
                restrictions contravene both the free software and open source definitions. To
                quote the &lt;a href="https://opensource.org/osd"&gt;Open Source
                Definition&lt;/a&gt;, clause 6:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a
                specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program from
                being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;No such restrictions are found in free or open source software licenses, be
                they
                permissive or copyleft &amp;ndash; all FOSS licenses permit the use of the software
                for
                any purpose without restriction. You can sell both permissive and copyleft
                software, use it as part of a commercial cloud service,&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a
                href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; use
                the software
                as part of a nuclear weapons program,&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:3"
                class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or do whatever
                else you want with
                it. There are no restrictions on how free software is used, regardless of if it
                is permissive or copyleft.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Copyleft does not impose restrictions, but it does impose obligations. The
                obligations exist to guarantee rights to the users of the software &amp;ndash; in
                other
                words, to ensure freedoms. In this respect copyleft licenses are &lt;em&gt;more
                free&lt;/em&gt;
                than permissive licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Freedom is a political concept, and in order to understand this, we must
                consider it in political terms, which is to say as an exercise in power
                dynamics. Freedom without obligation is a contradiction. Freedom
                &lt;em&gt;emerges&lt;/em&gt; from
                obligations, specifically obligations imposed on power.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Where does freedom come from?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Consider the United States as an example, a society which sets forth
                freedom as
                a core political value.&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:4"
                class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Freedoms in the
                US are ultimately grounded in the US
                constitution and its bill of rights. These tools create freedoms by guaranteeing
                rights to US citizens through the imposition of &lt;em&gt;obligations&lt;/em&gt; on
                the government.
                For instance, you have a right to an attorney when accused of a crime in the
                United States, and as such the government is &lt;em&gt;obliged&lt;/em&gt; to provide
                you with one.
                It is from obligations such as these that freedom emerges. Freedom of assembly,
                another example, is guaranteed such that the police are prevented from breaking
                up peaceful protests &amp;ndash; this freedom emerges from a
                &lt;em&gt;constraint&lt;/em&gt; (or
                restriction, if you must) on power (the government) as a means of guaranteeing
                the rights and freedom of those with less power by comparison (its
                citizens).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Who holds the power in the context of software?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Consider non-free software by contrast: software is written by corporations
                and
                sold on to users with substantial restrictions on its use. Corporations hold
                more power than individuals: they have more resources (e.g. money), more
                influence, and, in a sense more fundamental to the software itself, they retain
                in private the tools to understand the software, or to modify its behavior, and
                they dictate the conditions under which it may be used (e.g. only if your
                license key has not expired, or only for certain purposes). This is true of
                anyone who retains the source code in private and uses copyright law to enforce
                their will upon the software &amp;ndash; in this way they possess, and exercise,
                power
                over the user.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Permissive licenses do not provide any checks on this power; generally they
                preserve &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_rights"&gt;moral
                rights&lt;/a&gt; and little
                else. Permissive licenses provide for relatively few and narrow freedoms, and
                are not particularly &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; as such. Copyleft licenses constrain
                these powers
                through additional obligations, and from these obligations greater freedoms
                emerge. Specifically, they oblige reciprocity. They are distinguished from
                permissive licenses in this manner, but where permissive licenses
                &lt;em&gt;permit&lt;/em&gt;,
                copyleft does not &lt;em&gt;restrict&lt;/em&gt; per-se &amp;ndash; better terms
                might be &amp;ldquo;reciprocal&amp;rdquo; and
                &amp;ldquo;non-reciprocal&amp;rdquo;, but perhaps that ship has sailed.
                &amp;ldquo;You may use this software
                &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; is a statement made both by
                permissive and copyleft licenses, with
                different &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt;s. Neither form of license says &amp;ldquo;you
                cannot use this software &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt;
                &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;; licenses which do so are non-free.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Permissive licenses and copyleft licenses are both free software, but only
                the
                latter provides a guarantee of rights, and while both might be free only the
                latter provides &lt;em&gt;freedom&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"&gt;
                &lt;hr&gt;
                &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Strictly speaking this exception was for JSLint, not JSON. But I
                digress.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref"
                role="doc-backlink"&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This is even true if the software uses the AGPL license.&amp;#160;&lt;a
                href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref"
                role="doc-backlink"&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Take a moment here to entertain the supposition that nuclear warheads
                are legally obliged to include a copy of the MIT license, if they
                incorporate MIT licensed code in their guidance systems, on board, as they
                are &amp;ldquo;distributing&amp;rdquo; that software to the, err, recipients. As it
                were.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref"
                role="doc-backlink"&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The extent to which it achieves this has, of course, been the subject of
                intense debate for centuries.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:4"
                class="footnote-backref"
                role="doc-backlink"&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ol&gt;

            <title>FDO's conduct enforcement actions regarding Vaxry</title>
            <link>https://drewdevault.com/2024/04/09/2024-04-09-FDO-conduct-enforcement.html</link>
            <pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <guid>https://drewdevault.com/2024/04/09/2024-04-09-FDO-conduct-enforcement.html</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;freedesktop(.org), aka FDO, recently banned Hyprland maintainer
                Vaxry from the
                FDO community, and in response Vaxry has taken his case to the court of public
                opinion, publishing their email exchanges and writing about it on his
                blog.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It saddens me to bear witness to these events today. I wrote &lt;a
                href="https://drewdevault.com/2023/09/17/Hyprland-toxicity.html"&gt;in September of
                last year&lt;/a&gt; about problems with toxicity in the Hyprland community. I
                initially reached out to Vaxry to discuss these problems in private in February
                of last year. I failed to get through to him, leading to that blog post in
                September. I spent some time in the following weeks talking with Vaxry on his
                behavior and his community&amp;rsquo;s social norms, again in private, but again, I
                was
                unable to get through to him. Unfortunately, we find ourselves again leaving the
                private sphere and discussing Vaxry&amp;rsquo;s behavior and the problem posed by
                the
                Hyprland community once again.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The fact of the matter is that Hyprland remains a toxic community, enabled
                and
                encouraged by its toxic leadership, namely Vaxry. FDO&amp;rsquo;s decision to ban
                Vaxry is
                ultimately a consequence of Vaxry&amp;rsquo;s behavior, and because he has elected
                to
                appeal his case in public, I am compelled to address his behavior in public. I
                hereby rise firmly in defense of FDO&amp;rsquo;s decision.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I invite you to start by reading the two email threads, &lt;a
                href="https://blog.vaxry.net/resource/articleFDO/LyudeMails.pdf"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;,
                and &lt;a
                href="https://blog.vaxry.net/resource/articleFDO/lyudeReply.pdf"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;,
                which Vaxry has published for your consideration, as well as Vaxry&amp;rsquo;s
                follow-ups
                on his blog, &lt;a
                href="https://blog.vaxry.net/articles/2024-fdo-and-redhat"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, and
                &lt;a
                href="https://blog.vaxry.net/articles/2024-fdo-and-redhat2"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my read on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The FDO officer that reached out to Vaxry did it after Vaxry&amp;rsquo;s
                problematic
                behavior was brought to her attention by members of the FDO community, and was
                acting on her mandate within the FDO conduct enforcement board by investigating
                complaints submitted to her by this community. It is not a stretch to suggest a
                close relationship between these communities exists: FDO is the steward of both
                the Wayland protocol and implementation and the wlroots library, essential
                dependencies of Hyprland and sources for collaboration between Hyprland and FDO.
                Vaxry and other members of the Hyprland community had already participated
                extensively in these projects (mainly in discussions on IRC and GitLab issues)
                at the time of the email exchange, in spaces where the code of conduct
                applies.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The FDO officer duly investigated the complaints she had received and
                found, in
                collaboration with the other members of the FDO conduct enforcement team, that
                they were credible, and worrying. There are numerous examples of behavior from
                Vaxry that contravenes the FDO code of conduct in several different respects,
                and any number of them would be grounds for an immediate ban. Since these
                behaviors are concerning, but did not take place in the FDO community, the
                conduct board decided to issue a warning in private, stating that if this sort
                of behavior was seen in the FDO community that it would result in enforcement
                action from the conduct team.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;All of the actions from the FDO conduct team are reasonable and show
                considerable restraint. Vaxry could have taken it in stride with no consequences
                to himself. Instead, he immediately escalated the situation. He construes the
                FDO officer&amp;rsquo;s polite and well-reasoned warning as threats and
                intimidation. He
                minimizes examples of his own hate speech by shrugging them off as a joke. He
                belittles the FDO officer and builds a straw man wherein her email is an
                official statement on behalf of RedHat, and cites a conspiracy theory about
                &lt;abbr title="diversity, equity, and inclusion"&gt;DEI&lt;/abbr&gt; programs at
                RedHat as
                justification for calling the FDO officer a hypocrite. He is insulted on my
                behalf that my name was cited in the FDO officer&amp;rsquo;s email in lowercase,
                &amp;ldquo;drew&amp;rdquo;,
                and feels the need to address this.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The FDO officer responds to Vaxry&amp;rsquo;s unhinged rant with a
                sarcastic quip
                clarifying that it was indeed within the FDO conduct team&amp;rsquo;s remit to ban
                Vaxry
                from their GitLab instance &amp;ndash; I confess that in my view this was somewhat
                unprofessional, though I can easily sympathize with the FDO officer given the
                context. Following this, Vaxry states that Hyprland will cease all communication
                with FDO&amp;rsquo;s conduct team and &lt;em&gt;ignore&lt;/em&gt; (emphasis his) any
                future emails from them.
                Finally, he threatens legal action (on what basis is unclear) and signs the
                email.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Regardless of how you feel about the conduct team issuing a private warning
                to
                Vaxry on the basis of activities outside of FDO community spaces, the email
                thread that ensues most certainly is within the scope of the FDO code of
                conduct, and Vaxry&amp;rsquo;s behavior therein is sufficient justification for a
                ban from
                the FDO community as far as I&amp;rsquo;m concerned. The conduct team cites
                Vaxry&amp;rsquo;s stated
                intention to ignore any future conduct interventions as the ultimate reason for
                the ban, which I find entirely reasonable on FDO&amp;rsquo;s part. I have banned
                people
                for far less than this, and I stand by it.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Vaxry&amp;rsquo;s follow-up blog posts only serve to underscore this point.
                First of all,
                he immediately opens with a dog-whistle calling for the reader to harass the FDO
                officer in question: &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t condone harassing this person, but
                here is their
                full name, employer and contact details&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I do not condone any hateful messages sent towards any of the parties
                mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Recently I have received an email filled with threats to my inbox, from a
                member of the X.org board, Freedesktop.org, and a Red Hat employee. Their name
                is [redacted].&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Moreover, Vaxry claims to have apologised for his past conduct, which is
                not
                true. In lieu of an apology, Vaxry has spent the &amp;ldquo;1.5 years&amp;rdquo;
                since the last
                incident posting angry rants on his blog calling out minority representation and
                &amp;ldquo;social justice warriors&amp;rdquo; in light of his perceived persecution.
                Meanwhile the
                Hyprland community remains a toxic place, welcoming hate, bullying, and
                harassment, but now prohibiting all &amp;ldquo;political&amp;rdquo; speech, which in
                practice means
                any discussion of LGBTQ topics, though this is largely unenforced. In the end,
                the Hyprland community&amp;rsquo;s fundamental problem is that they&amp;rsquo;re all
                &amp;ldquo;just having
                fun&amp;rdquo;, and it seems that they can&amp;rsquo;t have
                &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; unless it&amp;rsquo;s at someone else&amp;rsquo;s
                expense.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The FDO team is right that Hyprland&amp;rsquo;s community reflects poorly
                on the Linux
                desktop community as a whole. Vaxry has created a foothold for hate,
                transphobia, homophobia, bullying, and harassment in the Linux desktop
                community. We are right to take action to correct this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Every option other than banning Vaxry has been exhausted over the past year
                and
                a half. I personally spent several weeks following my last blog post on the
                matter discussing Vaxry&amp;rsquo;s behavior in confidence and helping him
                understand how
                to improve, and at my suggestion he joined a private community of positive male
                role models to discuss these issues in a private and empathetic space. After a
                few weeks of these private discussions, the last thing he said to me was
                &amp;ldquo;I do
                believe there could be arguments to sway my opinion towards
                genocide&amp;rdquo;.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref"
                role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s nothing left to do but to build a fence around Hyprland
                and protect the
                rest of the community from them. I know that there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of good people
                who
                use and contribute to Hyprland, and I&amp;rsquo;m sorry for those of you who are
                affected
                by this problem. But, in the end, actions have consequences. The rest of the
                community has no choice but to sanction Vaxry.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;And, to Vaxry &amp;ndash; I know you&amp;rsquo;re reading this &amp;ndash;
                there are going to continue to be
                consequences for your actions, but it&amp;rsquo;s still not too late to change. I
                know
                it&amp;rsquo;s humiliating to be called out like this, and I really would rather not
                have
                had to do so. FDO is probably not the last time you&amp;rsquo;re going to be banned
                if you
                don&amp;rsquo;t change course, and it would reflect better on you if you took it on
                the
                chin and didn&amp;rsquo;t post inflammatory rants on your blog &amp;ndash; trust me,
                you don&amp;rsquo;t look
                like the good guy here. You are trapped in an echo chamber of hate, anger, and
                bigotry. I hope that you find a way out, and that someday you can build a
                community which is as great as your software is.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;And, to the FDO officer in question: I&amp;rsquo;m so sorry that
                you&amp;rsquo;re at the ass end of
                all of this hate and abuse. You don&amp;rsquo;t deserve any of it. You did a good
                job, and
                I&amp;rsquo;m proud of you and the rest of the FDO conduct team. If you need any
                support,
                someone to talk to, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to reach out and ask, on IRC, Matrix,
                email,
                whatever. Don&amp;rsquo;t read the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;And on that note, I condemn in the harshest terms the response from
                communities
                like /r/linux on the subject. The vile harassment and hate directed at the FDO
                officer in question is obscene and completely unjustifiable. I don&amp;rsquo;t care
                what
                window manager or desktop environment you use &amp;ndash; this kind of behavior is
                completely uncalled for. I expect better.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;hr&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S. The Hyprland community has already descended on me before
                even publishing
                this post, after I called Vaxry out on Mastodon a few hours ago. My
                notifications are not full of reasonable objections to my complaints, but
                instead the response is slurs and death threats. This only serves to prove my
                characterization of the Hyprland community as deeply toxic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"&gt;
                &lt;hr&gt;
                &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Yes, this is taken out of context. But, if you raise this objection, I
                struggle to imagine in what context you think this statement can be read
                sympathetically.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref"
                role="doc-backlink"&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ol&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

            <guid>https://drewdevault.com/2023/12/26/2023-12-26-Prusa-is-floundering.html</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Prusa is a 3D printer manufacturer which has a long history of
                being admired by
                the 3D printing community for high quality, open source printers. They have been
                struggling as of late, and came under criticism for making the firmware of their
                Mk4 printer non-free.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref"
                role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a
                href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2023/12/25/life-and-death-of-open-source/"&gt;Armin
                Ronacher&lt;/a&gt; uses Prusa as a case-study in why open source companies
                fail, and uses this example to underline his argument that open source needs to
                adapt for commercial needs, namely by adding commercial exclusivity clauses to
                its licenses &amp;ndash; Armin is one of the principal proponents of the non-free
                Functional Source License. Armin cites his experience with a Chinese
                manufactured 3D printer as evidence that intellectual property is at the heart
                of Prusa&amp;rsquo;s decline, and goes on to discuss how this dynamic applies to his
                own
                work in developing a non-free license for use with Sentry. I find this work
                pretty interesting &amp;ndash; FSL is a novel entry into the non-free license
                compendium,
                and it&amp;rsquo;s certainly a better way to do software than proprietary models,
                assuming
                that it&amp;rsquo;s not characterized as free or open source. But, allow me to use
                the
                same case study to draw different conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It is clear on the face of it that Prusa&amp;rsquo;s move to a non-free
                firmware is
                unrelated to their struggles with the Chinese competition &amp;ndash; their firmware
                was
                GPL&amp;rsquo;d, and the cited competitor (Bambu) evidently respects copyleft, and
                there&amp;rsquo;s
                no evidence that Bambu&amp;rsquo;s printers incorporate derivatives of
                Prusa&amp;rsquo;s firmware in
                a manner which violates the GPL. Making the license non-free is immaterial to
                the market dynamics between Prusa and Bambu, so the real explanation must lie
                elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If you had asked me 10 years ago what I expected Prusa&amp;rsquo;s largest
                risk would be,
                I would have simply answered &amp;ldquo;China&amp;rdquo; and you would have probably
                said the same.
                The Chinese economy and industrial base can outcompete Western manufacturing in
                almost every manufacturing market.&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:2"
                class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This was always
                the obvious
                vulnerability in their business model, and they &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt;
                needed to be
                prepared for this situation, or their death was all but certain. Prusa made one
                of the classic errors in open source business models: they made their product,
                made it open source, sold it, and assumed that they were done working on their
                business model.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It was inevitable that someday Chinese manufacturers would undercut Prusa
                on
                manufacturing costs. Prusa responded to this certainty by not diversifying their
                business model whatsoever. There has only ever been one Prusa product: their
                latest 3D printer model. The Mk4 costs $1,200. You can buy the previous
                generation (at $1,000), or the MINI (from 2019, $500). You can open your wallet
                and get their high-end printers, which are neat but fail to address the one
                thing that most users at this price-point really want, which is more build
                volume. Or, you can buy an Ender 3 off Amazon right now for $180 and
                you&amp;rsquo;ll get
                better than half of the value of an Mk4 at an 85% discount. You could also buy
                Creality&amp;rsquo;s flagship model for a cool $800 and get a product which beats
                the Mk4
                in every respect. China has joined the market, bringing with them all of the
                competitive advantages their industrial base can bring to bear, and
                Prusa&amp;rsquo;s
                naive strategy is causing their position to fall like a rock.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Someone new to 3D printing will pick up an Ender and will probably be happy
                with
                it for 1-2 years. When they upgrade, will they upgrade to a Prusa or an Ender 5?
                Three to five years a customer spends in someone else&amp;rsquo;s customer pipeline
                is an
                incredibly expensive opportunity cost Prusa is missing out on. This opportunity
                cost is the kind of arithmetic that would make loss leaders like a cheap,
                low-end, low-or-negative-margin Prusa printer make financial sense. Hell, Prusa
                should have made a separate product line of white-labeled Chinese entry-level 3D
                printers just to get people on the Prusa brand.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Prusa left many stones unturned. Bambu&amp;rsquo;s cloud slicer is a
                massive lost
                opportunity for Prusa. On-demand cloud printing services are another lost
                opportunity. Prusa could have built a marketplace for models &amp;amp; parts and
                skimmed
                a margin off of the top, but they waited until 2022 to launch Printables &amp;ndash;
                waiting until the 11th hour when everyone was fed up with Thingiverse. Imagine a
                Prusa where it works out of the box, you can fire up a slicer in your browser
                which auto-connects to your printer and prints models from a Prusa-operated
                model repository, paying $10 for a premium model, $1 off the top goes to Prusa,
                with the same saved payment details which ensure that a fresh spool of Prusa
                filament arrives at your front door when it auto-detects that your printer is
                almost out. The print you want is too big for your build volume? Click here to
                have it cloud printed &amp;ndash; do you want priority shipping for that? Your
                hot-end is
                reaching the end of its life &amp;ndash; as one of our valued business customers on

                &lt;p&gt;Prusa&amp;rsquo;s early foothold in the market was strong, and they were
                wise to execute
                the way they did early on. But they &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; had to diversify
                their lines of
                business. Prusa left gaping holes in the market and utterly failed to capitalize
                on any of them. Prusa could have been synonymous with 3D printing if they had
                invested in the brand (though they probably needed a better name). I should be
                able to walk into a Best Buy and pick up an entry-level Prusa for $250-$500, or
                into a Home Depot and pick up a workshop model for $1000-$2000. I should be able
                to bring it home, unbox it, scan a QR code to register it with PrusaConnect, and
                have a Benchy printing in less than 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Chinese manufacturers did all of this and more, and they&amp;rsquo;re
                winning. They aren&amp;rsquo;t
                just cheaper &amp;ndash; they offer an outright better product. These are not cheap
                knock-offs: if you want the best 3D printer today it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a
                Chinese
                one, regardless of how much you want to spend, but, as it happens, you&amp;rsquo;re
                going
                to spend less.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Note that none of this is material to the license of the product, be it
                free or
                non-free. It&amp;rsquo;s about building a brand, developing a customer relationship,
                and
                identifying and exploiting market opportunities. Hackers and enthusiasts who
                found companies like Prusa tend to imagine that the product is everything, but
                it&amp;rsquo;s not. Maybe 10% of the work is developing the 3D printer itself
                &amp;ndash;
                don&amp;rsquo;t abandon the other 90% of your business. Especially when you make
                that 10%
                open: someone else is going to repurpose it, do the other 90%, and eat your
                lunch. FOSS is &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; precisely because it makes that 10% into
                community
                property and shares the cost of innovation, but you&amp;rsquo;d be a fool to act as
                if
                that was all there was to it. You need to deal with sales and marketing, chase
                down promising leads, identify and respond to risks, look for and exploit new
                market opportunities, and much more to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This is a classic failure mode of open source businesses, and
                it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Prusa&amp;rsquo;s
                fault&lt;/em&gt;. They had an excellent foothold early in the market, leveraging
                open
                source and open hardware to great results and working hand-in-hand with
                enthusiasts early on to develop the essential technology of 3D printing. Then,
                they figured they were done developing their business model, and completely
                dropped the ball as a result. Open source is not an &amp;ldquo;if you build it, the
                money
                will come&amp;rdquo; situation, and to think otherwise is a grave mistake.
                Businesses need
                to identify their risks and then mitigate them, and if they don&amp;rsquo;t do that
                due
                diligence, then it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;their fault&lt;/em&gt; when it fails
                &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s not a problem with
                FOSS.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Free and open source software is an incredibly powerful tool, including as
                a
                commercial opportunity. FOSS really has changed the world! But building a
                business is still hard, and in addition to its fantastic advantages, the FOSS
                model poses important and challenging constraints that you need to understand
                and work with. You have to be creative, and you must do a risk/reward assessment
                to understand how it applies to your business and how you can utilize it for
                commercial success. Do the legwork and you can utilize FOSS for a competitive
                advantage, but skip this step and you will probably fail within a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I sourced this information from Armin&amp;rsquo;s blog post, but it
                didn&amp;rsquo;t
                hold up to a later fact check: the
                &lt;a href="https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware-Buddy"&gt;Mk4
                firmware&lt;/a&gt; seems to be
                free software. It seems the controversy here has to do with Prusa
                developing its slicer software behind closed doors and doing occasional
                source-code dumps, rather than managing a more traditional
                &amp;ldquo;bazaar&amp;rdquo; style
                project.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref"

                &lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;That said, there are still vulnerabilities in the Chinese industrial
                base that can be exploited by savvy Western entrepreneurs. Chinese access to
                Western markets is constrained below a certain scale, for instance, in ways
                that Western businesses are not.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:2"

            <pubDate>Sat, 25 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <guid>https://drewdevault.com/2023/11/25/2023-11-26-RMS-on-sex.html</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Richard Stallman, the founder of the Free Software Foundation, has
                been subject
                to numerous allegations of misconduct. He stepped down in 2019, and following
                his re-instatement in 2021, a famous &lt;a
                href="https://rms-open-letter.github.io/"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; was published in
                which
                numerous organizations and individuals from throughout the Free Software
                ecosystem called for his removal from the Free Software Foundation. The letter
                had no effect; Stallman remains a voting member of the FSF&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a
                href="https://www.fsf.org/about/staff-and-board"&gt;board of
                directors&lt;/a&gt; to this day and continues to receive numerous &lt;a
                href="https://stallman.org/talks.html"&gt;speaking
                engagements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Content warning: This article discusses sexual abuse, sexual
                assault, sexual
                harassment, and all of the above with respect to minors, as well as the systemic
                normalization of abuse, and directly quotes statements which participate in the
                normalization of abuse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This article presents an analysis of Stallman&amp;rsquo;s political
                discourse on sex with
                the aim of establishing the patterns that cause the sort of discomfort that led
                to Stallman&amp;rsquo;s public condemnation. In particular, we will address how
                Stallman
                speaks about sexual assault, harassment, consent, and minors in his
                discourse.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I think that it is important to acknowledge this behavior not as a series
                of
                isolated incidents, nor a conflict with Stallman&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;a
                href="https://www.fsf.org/news/statement-of-fsf-board-on-election-of-richard-stallman"&gt;personal
                style&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;,
                but a pattern of behavior from which a political narrative forms, and draws
                attention to the fact that the meager retractions, excuses, and non-apologies
                from both Stallman and the Free Software Foundation as a whole fail to account
                for that pattern in a meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The failure of the Free Software community to account for Richard
                Stallman&amp;rsquo;s
                behavior has a chilling effect. The norms set by our leadership influence the
                norms of our broader community, and many members of the Free Software community
                look to Stallman as a ideological and political leader. The norms Stallman
                endorses are harmful and deeply confronting and alienating to many people, in
                particular women and children. Should these norms be adopted by our movement, we
                risk creating a community which enables the exploitation of vulnerable
                people.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s begin to address this by considering Stallman&amp;rsquo;s
                retraction of his comments
                in support of pedophilia. The following comment from Stallman in 2013 drew harsh
                criticism:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;There is little evidence to justify the widespread assumption that willing
                participation in pedophilia hurts children.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a
                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210325014249/https://stallman.org/archives/2012-nov-feb.html#04_January_2013_(Pedophilia)"&gt;stallman.org,
                04 January 2013 &amp;ldquo;Pedophilia&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Following much of the criticism directed at Stallman, he had a number of
                &amp;ldquo;personal conversations&amp;rdquo; which reframed his views. Of the many
                comments Stallman
                has made which drew ire, this is one of the few for which a correction was made,
                in September 2019:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Many years ago I posted that I could not see anything wrong about sex
                between
                an adult and a child, if the child accepted it.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Through personal conversations in recent years, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to
                understand how
                sex with a child can harm per psychologically. This changed my mind about the
                matter: I think adults should not do that. I am grateful for the conversations
                that enabled me to understand why.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a
                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210325015259/https://stallman.org/archives/2019-jul-oct.html#14_September_2019_(Sex_between_an_adult_and_a_child_is_wrong)"&gt;stallman.org,
                14 September 2019 &amp;ldquo;Sex between an adult and a child is
                wrong&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This statement from Stallman has been accepted by his defenders as evidence
                of
                his capitulation on pedophilia. I argue that this statement is misleading due to
                the particular way Stallman uses the word &amp;ldquo;child&amp;rdquo;. When Stallman
                uses this word,
                he does so with a very specific meaning, which he explains on his website:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Children: Humans up to age 12 or 13 are children. After that, they become
                adolescents or teenagers. Let&amp;rsquo;s resist the practice of infantilizing
                teenagers, by not calling them &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a
                href="https://www.stallman.org/antiglossary.html"&gt;stallman.org,
                &amp;ldquo;Anti-glossary&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It seems clear from this definition is that Stallman&amp;rsquo;s comments
                are not a
                capitulation at all. His 2019 retraction, when interpreted using his definition
                of &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo;, does not contradict most of Stallman&amp;rsquo;s
                past statements regarding
                sex and minors, including his widely criticized defenses of many people accused
                of sexual impropriety with minors.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Stallman&amp;rsquo;s most recent direct response to his criticism
                underscores this:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It was right for me to talk about the injustice to Minsky, but it was
                tone-deaf that I didn&amp;rsquo;t acknowledge as context the injustice that Epstein
                did
                to women or the pain that caused.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a
                href="https://www.fsf.org/news/rms-addresses-the-free-software-community"&gt;fsf.org,
                April 12, 2021, &amp;ldquo;RMS addresses the free software
                community&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Stallman qualifies his apology by explicitly re-affirming his defense of
                Marvin
                Minsky, which is addressed in detail later in this piece. Stallman&amp;rsquo;s
                doubling-down here is consistent with the supposition that Stallman maintains
                the view that minors can have sexual relationships with adults of any age,
                provided that they aren&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; in
                other words, provided they&amp;rsquo;re at
                least 13 or 14 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Stallman cares deeply about language and its usage. His strange and
                deliberate
                usage of the word &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo; is also found many times throughout
                his political
                notes over the years. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It sounds horrible: &amp;ldquo;UN peacekeepers accused of child rape in
                South Sudan.&amp;rdquo;
                But the article makes it pretty clear that the &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo;
                involved were not
                children. They were teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a
                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180509120046/https://stallman.org/archives/2018-mar-jun.html#30_April_2018_(UN_peacekeepers_in_South_Sudan)"&gt;stallman.org,
                30 April 2018 &amp;ldquo;UN peacekeepers in South
                Sudan&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Here Stallman again explicitly distinguishes
                &amp;ldquo;teenagers&amp;rdquo; from children, drawing
                this distinction especially in the context of sexual relationships between
                adults and minors. Stallman repeats this pattern many times over the years
                &amp;ndash; we
                see it again in Stallman&amp;rsquo;s widely criticized defense of Cody
                Wilson:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Cody Wilson has been charged with hiring a &amp;ldquo;child&amp;rdquo; sex
                worker. Her age has
                not been announced, but I think she must surely be a teenager, not a child.
                Calling teenagers &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo; in this context is a way of
                smearing people with
                normal sexual proclivities as &amp;ldquo;perverts&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a
                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180924231708/https://stallman.org/archives/2018-jul-oct.html#23_September_2018_(Cody_Wilson)"&gt;stallman.org,
                23 September 2018 &amp;ldquo;Cody
                Wilson&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;And once more when defending Roy Moore:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Senate candidate Roy Moore tried to start dating/sexual relationships with
                teenagers some decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;He tried to lead Ms Corfman step by step into sex, but he always respected
                &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; from her and his other dates. Thus, Moore does not deserve
                the
                exaggerated condemnation that he is receiving for this. As an example of
                exaggeration: one mailing referred to these teenagers as
                &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo;, even the
                one that was 18 years old. Many teenagers are minors, but none of them are
                children.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The condemnation is surely sparked by the political motive of wanting to
                defeat Moore in the coming election, but it draws fuel from ageism and the
                fashion for overprotectiveness of &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a
                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180104112431/https://www.stallman.org/archives/2017-nov-feb.html#27_November_2017_(Roy_Moore's_relationships)"&gt;stallman.org,
                27 November 2017 &amp;ldquo;Roy Moore&amp;rsquo;s
                relationships&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Ms. Corfman was 14 at the time Roy Moore is accused of initiating sexual
                contact
                with her; Moore was 32 at the time. Here we see an example of him re-iterating
                his definition of &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo;, a distinction he draws especially
                to suggest that
                an adult having sex with a minor is socially acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Note that Stallman refers to Ms. Corfman as Moore&amp;rsquo;s
                &amp;ldquo;date&amp;rdquo;. Stallman&amp;rsquo;s use of
                this word is important: here he normalizes the possibility that a minor and an
                adult could engage in a healthy dating relationship. In this statement, Stallman
                cites an article which explains circumstances which do not resemble such a
                normalized dating experience: Moore isolated Corfman from her mother, drove her
                directly to his home, and initiated sexual contact there.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Note also that the use of the phrase &amp;ldquo;step by step&amp;rdquo; in
                this quotation is more
                commonly referred to as &amp;ldquo;grooming&amp;rdquo; in the discourse on child
                sexual
                exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Stallman reaches for similar reasoning in other political notes, such as
                the
                following:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A British woman is on trial for going to a park and inviting teenage boys
                to
                have sex with her there. Her husband acted as a lookout in case someone else
                passed by. One teenager allegedly visited her at her house repeatedly to have
                sex with her.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;None of these acts would be wrong in any sense, provided they took
                precautions
                against spreading infections. The idea that adolescents (of whatever sex) need
                to be &amp;ldquo;protected&amp;rdquo; from sexual experience they wish to have is
                prudish
                ignorantism, and making that experience a crime is perverse.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a
                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612074722/http://stallman.org/archives/2017-mar-jun.html#26_May_2017_(Prudish_ignorantism)"&gt;stallman.org,
                26 May 2017, &amp;ldquo;Prudish
                ignorantism&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The woman in question, aged 60, had sex with her husband, age 69, in a
                public
                space, and invited spectators as young as 11 to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Stallman has also sought to normalize adult attraction to minors, literally
                describing it as &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; in September 2018:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Calling teenagers &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo; encourages treating
                teenagers as children, a
                harmful practice which retards their development into capable adults.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In this case, the effect of that mislabeling is to smear Wilson. It is
                rare,
                and considered perverse, for adults to be physically attracted to children.
                However, it is normal for adults to be physically attracted to adolescents.
                Since the claims about Wilson is the latter, it is wrong to present it as the
                former.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a
                href="https://www.stallman.org/archives/2018-sep-dec.html#23_September_2018_(Cody_Wilson)"&gt;stallman.org,
                23 September 2018, &amp;ldquo;Cody
                Wilson&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;One month prior, Stallman made a statement which similarly normalized adult
                attraction to minors, and suggests that acting on this attraction should be
                acceptable to society, likening opposition to this view to homosexual conversion
                therapy:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This accords with the view that Stendhal reported in France in the 1800s,
                that a woman&amp;rsquo;s most beautiful years were from 16 to 20.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Although this attitude on men&amp;rsquo;s part is normal, the author still
                wants to
                present it as wrong or perverted, and implicitly demands men somehow control
                their attraction to direct it elsewhere. Which is as absurd, and as
                potentially oppressive, as claiming that homosexuals should control their
                attraction and direct it towards to the other sex. Will men be pressured to
                undergo &amp;ldquo;age conversion therapy&amp;rdquo; intended to brainwash them to
                feel attracted
                mainly to women of their own age?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a
                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180911075211/https://www.stallman.org/archives/2018-jul-oct.html#21_August_2018_(Age_and_attraction)"&gt;stallman.org,
                21 August 2018, &amp;ldquo;Age and
                attraction&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A trend is thus clearly seen in Stallman&amp;rsquo;s regular political
                notes, over several
                years, wherein Stallman re-iterates his position that
                &amp;ldquo;adolescents&amp;rdquo; or
                &amp;ldquo;teenagers&amp;rdquo; are distinct from &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo; for
                the purpose of having sex with
                adults, and normalizes and defends adult attraction to minors and adults who
                perform sexual acts with minors. We see this distinction of the two groups,
                children and adolescents, outlined again on his &amp;ldquo;anti-glossary&amp;rdquo;,
                which still
                published on his website today, albeit without the connotations of sex. His
                regular insistence on a definition of children which excludes adolescents
                serves such that his redaction of his controversial 2013 comment serves to
                redact none of the other widely-condemned comments he has made since.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Stallman has often written political notes when people accused of sexual
                impropriety, particularly with minors, appear in the news, or appear among
                Stallman&amp;rsquo;s social circle. Stallman&amp;rsquo;s comments generally downplay
                the abuse and
                manipulate language in a manner which benefits perpetrators of abuse. We see
                this downplaying in another example from 2019:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Should we accept stretching the terms &amp;ldquo;sexual abuse&amp;rdquo;
                and &amp;ldquo;molestation&amp;rdquo; to
                include looking without touching?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I do not accept it.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a
                href="https://www.stallman.org/archives/2019-may-aug.html#11_June_2019_(Stretching_meaning_of_terms)"&gt;stallman.org,
                11 June 2019 &amp;ldquo;Stretching meaning of
                terms&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Stallman is writing here in response to a news article outlining
                accusations of
                sexual misconduct directed at Ohio State athletics doctor Richard Strauss.
                Strauss was accused of groping at least 177 students between 1979 and 1997
                during routine physical exams, accusations corroborated by at least 50 members
                of the athletic department staff.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In addition to Stallman&amp;rsquo;s regular fixation of the use of the word
                &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo;
                with respect to sex, this political note also draws our attention to the next
                linguistic fixation of Stallman I want to question: the use of phrases like
                &amp;ldquo;sexual abuse&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sexual assault&amp;rdquo;. The
                term &amp;ldquo;sexual assault&amp;rdquo; also appears in
                Stallman&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Anti-glossary&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Sexual assault: The term is applied to a broad range of actions, from rape
                on
                one end, to the least physical contact on the other, as well as everything in
                between. It acts as propaganda for treating them all the same. That would be
                wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The term is further stretched to include sexual harassment, which does not
                refer to a single act, but rather to a series of acts that amounts to a form
                of gender bias. Gender bias is rightly prohibited in certain situations for
                the sake of equal opportunity, but that is a different issue.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think that rape should be treated the same as a momentary
                touch.
                People we accuse have a right to those distinctions, so I am careful not to
                use the term &amp;ldquo;sexual assault&amp;rdquo; to categorize the actions of any
                person on any
                specific occasion.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a
                href="https://www.stallman.org/antiglossary.html"&gt;stallman.org,
                &amp;ldquo;Anti-glossary&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Stallman often fixates on the term &amp;ldquo;sexual assault&amp;rdquo;
                throughout his political
                notes. He feels that the term fails to distinguish between
                &amp;ldquo;grave&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;minor&amp;rdquo;
                crimes, as he illustrated in 2021:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sexual assault&amp;rdquo; is so vague that it makes no sense as
                a charge. Because of
                that term, we can&amp;rsquo;t whether these journalists were accused of a grave
                crime
                or a minor one. However, the charge of espionage shows this is political
                persecution.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a
                href="https://stallman.org/archives/2021-jul-oct.html#21_July_2021_(Imprisonment_of_journalists)"&gt;stallman.org,
                21 July 2021, &amp;ldquo;Imprisonment of
                journalists&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I would like to find out what kind of crimes Stallman feels the need to
                distinguish along this axis. His other political notes give us some hints,
                such as this one regarding Al Franken&amp;rsquo;s sexual misconduct
                scandal:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If it is true that he persistently pressured her to kiss him, on stage and
                off, if he stuck his tongue into her mouth despite her objections, that could
                well be sexual harassment. He should have accepted no for an answer the first
                time she said it. However, calling a kiss &amp;ldquo;sexual assault&amp;rdquo; is an
                exaggeration,
                an attempt to equate it to much graver acts, that are crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;sexual assault&amp;rdquo; encourages that injustice,
                and I believe it has been
                popularized specifically with that intention. That is why I reject that
                term.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a

                &lt;p&gt;Stallman also wrote in 2020 to question the use of the phrase
                again:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the US, when thugs&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1"

                say are suspects, it is
                rare to bring them to justice.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I object to describing any one crime as &amp;ldquo;sexual
                assault&amp;rdquo; because that is vague
                about the severity of the crime. This article often uses that term to refer to
                many crimes that differ in severity but raise the same issue. That may be a
                valid practice.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;

                suspects&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the article Stallman cites in this political note, various unwelcome
                sexual
                acts by the police are described, the least severe of which is probably
                molestation.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;More alarmingly, Stallman addresses his views on the term &amp;ldquo;sexual
                assault&amp;rdquo; in
                this 2017 note, affording for the possibility that a 35-year-old man could have
                had consensual sex with an 11-year-old girl.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Jelani Maraj (who I had never heard of) could be imprisoned for a long time
                for &amp;ldquo;sexual assault&amp;rdquo;. What does that concretely mean?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Due to the vagueness of the term &amp;ldquo;sexual assault&amp;rdquo;
                together with the dishonest
                law that labels sex with adolescents as &amp;ldquo;rape&amp;rdquo; even if they are
                willing, we
                cannot tell from this article what sort of acts Maraj was found to have
                committed. So we can&amp;rsquo;t begin to judge whether those acts were
                wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I see at least three possibilities. Perhaps those acts really constituted
                rape — it is a possibility. Or perhaps the two had sex willingly, but her
                parents freaked out and demanded prosecution. Or, intermediate between those
                two, perhaps he pressured her into having sex, or got her drunk.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;

                Maraj&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Another article by Stallman does not explicitly refer to sexual assault,
                but
                does engage in a bizarre defense of a journalist who was fired for masturbating
                during a video conference. In this article Stallman fixates on questions such as
                whether or not the genitals being in view of the webcam was intentional or not,
                and suggests that masturbating on a video call would be acceptable should the
                genitals remain unseen.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The New Yorker&amp;rsquo;s unpublished note to staff was vague about its
                grounds for
                firing Toobin. Indeed, it did not even acknowledge that he had been fired.
                This is unfair, like convicting someone on unstated charges. Something
                didn&amp;rsquo;t
                meet its &amp;ldquo;standards of conduct&amp;rdquo;, but it won&amp;rsquo;t tell us
                what — we can only
                guess. What are the possibilities? Intentionally engaging in video-call sex as
                a side activity during a work meeting? If he had not made a mistake in keeping
                that out of view of the coworkers, why would it make a difference what the
                side activity was?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a
                href="https://www.stallman.org/articles/toobin.html"&gt;stallman.org, November 2020,
                &amp;ldquo;On the Firing of Jeffrey
                Toobin&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Finally, Stallman elaborated on his thoughts on the term most recently in
                October 2023. This note gives the clearest view of Stallman&amp;rsquo;s preferred
                distinction between various sexual crimes:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I warned that the stretchable term &amp;ldquo;sexual assault&amp;rdquo;,
                which extends from grave
                crimes such as rape through significant crimes such as groping and down to no
                clear lower bound, could be stretched to criminalize minor things, perhaps
                even stealing a kiss. Now this has happened.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;What next? Will a pat on the arm or a hug be criminalized? There is no
                clear
                limit to how far this can go, when a group builds up enough outrage to push
                it.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a
                href="https://www.stallman.org/archives/2023-sep-dec.html#15_October_2023_(Sexual_assault_for_stealing_a_kiss)"&gt;stallman.org,
                15 October 2023, &amp;ldquo;Sexual assault for stealing a
                kiss&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;From Stallman&amp;rsquo;s statements, we can refine his objection to the
                term &amp;ldquo;sexual
                assault&amp;rdquo;, and sexual behaviors generally, to further suggest that the
                following
                beliefs are held by Stallman on the subject:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Groping and molestation are not sexual assault, but are crimes&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Kissing someone without consent is not sexual assault, furthermore it is
                not wrong&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Masturbating during a video conference is not wrong if you are not seen
                doing so&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;A 35-year-old man having sex with an 11-year-old girl does not constitute
                rape, nor sexual assault, but is in fact conscionable&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The last of these may be covered under Stallman&amp;rsquo;s 2019
                retraction, even
                accounting for Stallman&amp;rsquo;s unconventional use of the word
                &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Stallman&amp;rsquo;s fixation on the term &amp;ldquo;sexual
                assault&amp;rdquo; can be understood in his
                political notes as having the political aims of eroding the meaning of the
                phrase, questioning the boundaries of consent, downplaying the importance of
                agency in intimate interactions, appealing for the defense of people accused of
                sexual assault, and arguing for sexual relationships between minors and adults
                to be normalized. In one notable case, he has used this political angle to rise
                to the defense of his friends &amp;ndash; in Stallman&amp;rsquo;s infamous email
                regarding Marvin
                Minsky, he writes the following:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The injustice [done to Minsky] is in the word “assaulting”. The term
                “sexual
                assault” is so vague and slippery that it facilitates accusation inflation:
                taking claims that someone did X and leading people to think of it as Y, which
                is much worse than X.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;(&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The word “assaulting” presumes that he applied force or violence, in some
                unspecified way, but the article itself says no such thing. Only that they had
                sex.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We can imagine many scenarios, but the most plausible scenario is that she
                presented herself to him as entirely willing. Assuming she was being coerced
                by Epstein, he would have had every reason to tell her to conceal that from
                most of his associates.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I’ve concluded from various examples of accusation inflation that it is
                absolutely wrong to use the term “sexual assault” in an accusation.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— Excerpt from &lt;a
                href="https://scribe.rip/medium.com/@selamie/remove-richard-stallman-fec6ec210794"&gt;Selam
                G&amp;rsquo;s recount of Stallman&amp;rsquo;s email&lt;/a&gt; to MIT Computer
                Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory mailing list, September 2019.
                Selam&amp;rsquo;s quotation has been corroborated by other sources.
                Minsky is, in this context, accused of having had a sexual encounter with a
                minor facilitated by convicted child trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. The original
                accusation does not state that this sexual encounter actually occurred; only
                that the minor in question was instructed to have sex with Minsky. Minsky would
                have been at least 75 years old at the time of the alleged incident; the minor
                was 16.
                &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;There is an important, but more subtle pattern in Stallman&amp;rsquo;s
                statements that I
                want to draw your attention to here: Stallman appears to have little to no
                understanding of the role of power dynamics in sexual harassment, assault, and
                rape. Stallman appears to reject the supposition that these acts could occur
                without an element of outwardly apparent violent coercion.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This is most obviously evidenced by his statements regarding the sexual
                abuse of
                minors; most people understand that minors cannot consent to sex even if they
                &amp;ldquo;appear willing&amp;rdquo;, in particular because an adult in this
                situation is exploiting
                a difference in experience and maturity to manipulate the child into sexually
                satisfying them &amp;ndash; in other words, a power differential. Stallman seems to
                reject this understanding of consent in his various defenses of people accused
                of sexual impropriety with minors, and in cases where the pretense of consent
                cannot be easily established, he offers the perpetrator the benefit of the
                doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We can also find an example of Stallman disregarding power dynamics with
                respect
                to adults in the following political note from 2017:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A famous theater director had a habit of pestering women, asking them for
                sex.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell from this article, he didn&amp;rsquo;t try to force
                women into sex.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;When women persistently said no, he does not seem to have tried to punish
                them.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The most he did was ask.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;He was a pest, but nothing worse than that.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a
                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180131020215/https://stallman.org/archives/2017-jul-oct.html#29_October_2017_(Pestering_women)"&gt;stallman.org,
                29 October 2017, &amp;ldquo;Pestering
                women&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In this case we have an example of &amp;ldquo;quid pro quo&amp;rdquo;, a
                kind of sexual harassment
                which weaponizes power dynamics for sexual gratification. This kind of sexual
                harassment is explicitly cited as illegal by Title VII of the US Civil Rights
                Act. A lack of competence in this respect displayed by Stallman, whose position
                in the Free Software Foundation board of directors requires that he act in a
                manner consistent with this law, is alarming.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I have identified this blindness to power dynamics as a recurring theme in
                Stallman&amp;rsquo;s comments on sexual abuse, be it with respect to sexual
                relationships
                between minors and adults, managers and subordinates, students and teachers, or
                public figures and their audience. I note for the reader that Stallman has held
                and currently holds several of these positions of power.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In addition to his position as a voting member of the Free Software
                Foundation&amp;rsquo;s
                Board of Directors, Stallman is still invited to speak at events and
                conferences. &lt;a
                href="https://github.com/ddol/rre-rms/blob/master/fulltext/20111018.txt"&gt;Stallman&amp;rsquo;s
                infamous rider&lt;/a&gt; prescribes a number of his
                requirements for attending an event; most of his conditions are relatively
                reasonable, though amusing. In this document, he states his preference for being
                accommodated in private, on a &amp;ldquo;spare couch&amp;rdquo;, when he travels. At
                these events,
                in these private homes, he may be afforded many opportunities to privacy with
                vulnerable people, including minors that, in his view, can consent to having sex
                with adults.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In summary, Stallman has a well-documented and oft-professed set of
                political
                beliefs which reject the social and legal norms regarding consent. He is not
                simply quietly misled in these beliefs; rather he advocates for these values
                using his political platform. He has issued no meaningful retractions of these
                positions or apologies for harm caused, and has continued to pursue a similar
                agenda since his return to the FSF board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This creates a toxic environment not only in the Free Software Foundation
                and in
                Stallman&amp;rsquo;s direct purview, but in the broader Free Software movement. The
                free
                software movement is culturally poisoned by our support of Stallman as our
                ideological leader. The open letter calling for Stallman&amp;rsquo;s removal
                received
                3,000 signatures; the counter-letter in support of Stallman received 6,876
                before it stopped accepting submissions.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Richard Stallman founded the Free Software Foundation in 1985, and has
                performed
                innumerable works to the benefit of our community since then. We&amp;rsquo;ve taken
                Stallman&amp;rsquo;s views on software freedom seriously, and they&amp;rsquo;ve led
                us to great
                achievements. It is to Stallman&amp;rsquo;s credit that the Free Software community
                is
                larger than one man. However, one&amp;rsquo;s political qualifications to speak
                about free
                software does not make one qualified to address matters of sex; in this respect
                Stallman&amp;rsquo;s persistence presents as dangerous incompetence.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;When we consider his speech on sex as a discourse that has been crafted and
                rehearsed methodically over the years, he asks us to consider him seriously, and
                so we must. When we analyze the dangerous patterns in this discourse, we have to
                conclude that he is not fit for purpose in his leadership role, and we must
                acknowledge the shadow that our legitimization of his discourse casts on our
                community.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Stallman consistently refers to police officers as

            <pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <guid>https://drewdevault.com/2023/11/09/Can-I-be-on-your-podcast.html</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;I am working on rousing the &lt;a
                href="https://harelang.org"&gt;Hare&lt;/a&gt; community to get the
                word out about our work. I have drafted the &lt;a
                href="https://harelang.org/evangelism/"&gt;Hare evangelism&lt;/a&gt; guidelines to
                this effect, which summarizes how we want to see our community bringing Hare to
                more people.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;d like to spread the word in a way which is respectful of the
                attention of
                others &amp;ndash; we&amp;rsquo;re explicitly eschewing unsolicited prompts for
                projects to
                consider writing/rewriting in Hare, as well as any paid sponsorships or
                advertising. Blog posts about Hare, videos, participating in (organic) online
                discussions &amp;ndash; much better! And one idea we have is to talk about Hare on
                podcasts which might be interested in the project.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If that describes your podcast, here&amp;rsquo;s my bold request: can I
                make an
                appearance?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Here are some mini &amp;ldquo;press kits&amp;rdquo; to give you a hook and
                some information that
                might be useful for preparing an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

                language&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Hare is a systems programming language designed to be simple, stable, and
                robust. Hare uses a static type system, manual memory management, and a
                minimal runtime. It is well-suited to writing operating systems, system tools,
                compilers, networking software, and other low-level, high performance
                tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Hare has been in development since late 2019 and today has about 100
                contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>On "real name" policies</title>
            <link>https://drewdevault.com/2023/10/31/On-real-names.html</link>
            <pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <guid>https://drewdevault.com/2023/10/31/On-real-names.html</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Some free software projects reject anonymous or pseudonymous
                contributions,
                requiring you to author patches using your &amp;ldquo;real name&amp;rdquo;. Such
                projects have a
                so-called &amp;ldquo;real name&amp;rdquo; policy; Linux is one well-known
                example.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref"
                role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The root motivations behind such policies vary, but in my experience the
                most
                often cited rationale is that it&amp;rsquo;s important to establish the provenance
                of the
                contribution for copyright reasons. In the case of Linux, contributors are asked
                to &amp;ldquo;sign-off&amp;rdquo; their commits to indicate their agreement to the
                terms of the
                Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO), which includes clauses like the
                following:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right
                to
                submit it under the open source license indicated in the file.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To some extent, the DCO serves as a legal assertion of copyright and an
                agreement to license a work under given copyright terms (GPLv2 in the case of
                Linux). This record also means that the author of the code is accountable in
                case the copyright is challenged; in the case of an anonymous or pseudonymous
                contributor you&amp;rsquo;re shit out of luck. At that point, liability over the
                disagreement would likely fall into the hands of the maintainer that accepted
                the contribution. It is reasonable for a maintainer to ask a contributor to
                assert their copyright and accept liability over the provenance of their code in
                a legally meaningful and accountable form.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The possibility that someone may have something useful to offer to a free
                software project, but is not comfortable disclosing their name for any number of
                reasons, is a reasonable supposition. A maintainer whose &amp;ldquo;real
                name&amp;rdquo; policy is
                challenged on this basis would also be reasonable in saying &amp;ldquo;I feel for
                you, but
                I cannot agree to accept legal liability over the provenance of this code,
                nor can I communicate that risk to end-users who acquire code under a license
                that may or may not be valid as such&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Real name&amp;rdquo; policies are controversial in the free
                software community. I open
                with this perspective in an attempt to cool down the room. Those who feel
                marginalized by &amp;ldquo;real name&amp;rdquo; policies often skew young, and many
                treat matters
                such as copyright and licensing with disdain. Moreover, the problem tends to
                inflame deeply hurtful sentiments and raise thorny matters of identity and
                discrimination, and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to construe the intent of the policymakers
                as the
                intent to cause harm. The motivations behind these policies are
                reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;That said, intent or otherwise, these policies can cause harm. The profile
                of
                the contributor who is comfortable using their &amp;ldquo;real name&amp;rdquo; is
                likely to fall
                more narrowly into over-represented demographics in our community; enforcing a
                real-name policy will ostracize some people. Those with marginalized identities
                tend to be less comfortable with disclosing their &amp;ldquo;real name&amp;rdquo;.
                Someone who has
                been subject to harassment may not be comfortable with this disclosure, since it
                offers more fuel to harassers keeping tabs on their activities. The use of a
                &amp;ldquo;real name&amp;rdquo; also confers a gender bias; avoiding a
                &amp;ldquo;real name&amp;rdquo; policy neatly
                eliminates discrimination on this basis. Of course, there are also many
                &lt;a
                href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/"&gt;falsehoods
                programmers believe about names&lt;/a&gt; which can present in the
                implementation of such a policy.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;There is also one particular problem which has been at the heart of
                conflict
                surrounding the use of &amp;ldquo;real-name&amp;rdquo; policies in free software:
                transgender
                identities. A transgender person is likely to change their name in the process
                of assuming their new identity. When this happens, their real name changes.
                However, it may or may not match their legal name &amp;ndash; some trans people opt
                to
                change it, others don&amp;rsquo;t; if they do it is a process that takes time.
                Meanwhile,
                addressing a trans person by their old name, or &amp;ldquo;deadname&amp;rdquo;, is
                highly
                uncomfortable. Doing so deliberately, as a matter of policy or otherwise, is a
                form of discrimination. Many trans people experience deliberate
                &amp;ldquo;deadnaming&amp;rdquo; as
                a form of harassment in their daily lives, and institutionalizing this behavior
                is cruel.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The truth is, managing the names of participants is more challenging than
                anyone
                would like. On the one hand, names establish accountability and facilitate
                collaboration, and importantly, credit the authors of a work for services
                performed. On the other hand, names are highly personal and deeply affecting,
                and their usage and changes over time are the subject of important consideration
                at the discretion of their owner. A complicating factor is that handling names
                properly introduces technical problems which must be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To embrace the advantages of &amp;ldquo;real name&amp;rdquo; policies
                &amp;ndash; establishing provenance,
                encouraging accountability, fostering a social environment &amp;ndash; without
                causing
                harm, the approach I have settled on for my projects is to use the DCO to
                establish provenance and encourage contributors to sign-off and participate
                under the identity they feel most comfortable with. I encourage people to
                utilize an identity they use beyond the project&amp;rsquo;s walls, to foster a
                social
                environment and a connection to the broader community, to establish
                accountability, and to ensure that participants are reachable for further
                discussion on their work. If a contributor&amp;rsquo;s identity changes, we make
                every
                effort to support this change in contemporary, future, and historical use.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Going off-script</title>
            <link>https://drewdevault.com/2023/10/13/Going-off-script.html</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 13 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <guid>https://drewdevault.com/2023/10/13/Going-off-script.html</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a phenomenon in society which I find quite bizarre. Upon
                our entry to
                this mortal coil, we are endowed with self-awareness, agency, and free will.
                Each of the 8 billion members of this human race represents a unique person, a
                unique worldview, and a unique agency. Yet, many of us have the same fundamental
                goals and strive to live the same life.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I think of such a life experiences as &amp;ldquo;following the
                script&amp;rdquo;. Society lays down
                for us a framework for living out our lives. Everyone deviates from the script
                to some extent, but most people hit the important beats. In Western society,
                these beats are something like, go to school, go to college, get a degree, build
                a career, get married, have 1.5 children, retire to Florida, die.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;There are a number of reasons that someone may deviate from the script. The
                most
                common case is that the deviations are imposed by circumstance. A queer person
                will face discrimination, for instance, in marriage, or in adopting and raising
                children. Someone born into the lower class will have reduced access to higher
                education and their opportunities for career-building are curtailed accordingly;
                similar experiences follow for people from marginalized groups. Furthermore,
                more and more people who might otherwise be able to follow the script are
                finding that they can&amp;rsquo;t afford a home and don&amp;rsquo;t have the
                resources to build a
                family.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;There are nevertheless many people who are afforded the opportunity to
                follow
                the script, and when they do so, they often experience something resembling a
                happy and fulfilling life. Generally this is not the result of a deliberate
                choice &amp;ndash; no one was presented with the script and asked &amp;ldquo;is this
                what you
                want&amp;rdquo;? Each day simply follows the last and you make the choices that
                correspond
                with what you were told a good life looks like, and sometimes a good life
                follows.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Of course, it is entirely valid to want the &amp;ldquo;scripted&amp;rdquo;
                life. But you were not
                asked if you wanted it: it was just handed to you on a platter. The average
                person lacks the philosophical background which underpins their worldview and
                lifestyle, and consequently cannot explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it&amp;rsquo;s
                &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo;, for them or
                generally. Consider your career. You were told that it was a desirable thing to
                build for yourself, and you understand how to execute your duties as a member of
                the working class, but can you explain why those duties are important and why
                you should spend half of your waking life executing them? Of course, if you are
                good at following the script, you are rewarded for doing so, generally with
                money, but not necessarily with self-actualization.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This state of affairs leads to some complex conflicts. This approach to
                life
                favors the status quo and preserves existing power structures, which explains in
                part why it is re-enforced by education and broader social pressures. It also
                leads to a sense of learned helplessness, a sense that this is the only way
                things can be, which reduces the initiative to pursue social change &amp;ndash; for
                example, by forming a union.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It can also be uncomfortable to encounter someone who does not follow the
                script, or even questions the script. You may be playing along, and mostly or
                entirely exposed to people who play along. Meeting someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t
                &amp;ndash; they
                skipped college, they don&amp;rsquo;t want kids, they practice polyamory, they
                identify as
                a gender other than what you presumed, etc &amp;ndash; this creates a moment of
                dissonance and often resistance. This tends to re-enforce biases and can even
                present as inadvertent micro-aggressions.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to question the script, even if you decide
                that you like
                it. You should be able to explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you like it. This process
                of questioning
                is a radical act. A radical, in its non-pejorative usage, is born when someone
                questions their life and worldview, decides that they want something else, and
                seeks out others who came to similar conclusions. They organize, they examine
                their discomfort and put it to words, and they share these words in the hope
                that they can explain a similar discomfort that others might feel within
                themselves. Radical movements, which by definition is any movement which
                challenges the status quo, are the stories of the birth and spread of radical
                ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Ask yourself: who are you? Did you choose to be this person? Who do you
                want to
                be, and how will you become that person? Should you change your major? Drop out?
                Quit your job, start a business, found a labor union? Pick up a new hobby? Join
                or establish a social club? An activist group? Get a less demanding job, move
                into a smaller apartment, and spend more time writing or making art? However you
                choose to live, choose it deliberately.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The next step is an exercise in solidarity. How do you feel about others
                who
                made their own choices, choices which may be alike or different to your own?
                Or those whose choices were constrained by their circumstances? What can you do
                together that you couldn&amp;rsquo;t do alone?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Who do you want to be? Do you know?&lt;/p&gt;

            <pubDate>Fri, 29 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <guid>https://drewdevault.com/2023/09/29/The-forbidden-topics.html</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;There are forbidden topics in the hacker community. One is sternly
                reprimanded
                for bringing them up, by their peers, their leaders, and the community at large.
                In private, one can expect threats and intimidation; in public, outcry and
                censorship. The forbidden topics are enforced by the moderators of our spaces,
                taken off of forums, purged from chat rooms, and cleaned up from GitHub issues
                and mailing lists; the ban-hammers fall swiftly and resolutely. My last article
                to touch these subjects was removed from Hacker News by the moderators within 30
                minutes and landed several death threats in my inbox. The forbidden topics, when
                raised, are met with a resounding, aggressive dismissal and unconditional
                condemnation.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Some years ago, the hacker community possessed near-unanimous praise for
                the
                ideals of free speech; the hacker position was generally that of what we would
                now understand as &amp;ldquo;radical&amp;rdquo; free speech, which is to say the
                kind of &amp;ldquo;shout
                &amp;lsquo;fire&amp;rsquo; in a crowded movie theater&amp;rdquo; radical, but more
                specifically the kind that
                tolerates hate speech. The popular refrain went, &amp;ldquo;I disapprove of what you
                say,
                but I will defend to the death your right to say it&amp;rdquo;. Many hackers hold
                this as
                a virtue to this day. I once held this as a virtue for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;However, this was a kind of free speech which was unconsciously contingent
                on
                being used for speech with which the listener was comfortable. The hacker
                community at this time was largely homogeneous, and as such most of the speech
                we were exposed to was of the comfortable sort. As the world evolved around us,
                and more people found their voice, this homogeneity began to break down. Critics
                of radical free speech, victims of hate speech, and marginalized people of
                all kinds began to appear in hacker communities. The things they had to say were
                not comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The free speech absolutists among the old guard, faced with this
                discomfort,
                developed a tendency to defend hate speech and demean speech that challenged
                them. They were not the target of the hate, so it did not make them personally
                uncomfortable, and defending it would maintain the pretense of defending free
                speech, of stalwartly holding the line on a treasured part of their personal
                hacker ethic. Speech which challenged their preconceptions and challenged their
                power structures was not so easily acceptable. The pretense is dropped and they
                lash out in anger, calling for the speakers to be excluded from our
                communities.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Some of the once-forbidden topics are becoming less so. There are carefully
                chalked-out spaces where we can talk about them, provided they are not too
                challenging, such as LGBTQ identities or the struggles of women in our spaces.
                Such discussions are subject to careful management by our leaders and
                moderators, to the extent necessary to preserve power structures. Those who
                speak on these topics are permitted to do so relatively free of retaliation
                provided that they speak from a perspective of humility, a voice that
                &amp;ldquo;knows its
                place&amp;rdquo;. Any speech which suggests that the listener may find themselves
                subject
                to a non-majority-conforming person in a position of power, or even that of a
                peer, will have crossed the line; one must speak as a victim seeking the pity
                and grace of your superiors to be permitted space to air your grievances.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Similarly, space is made for opposition to progressive speech, again
                moderated
                only insofar as it is necessary to maintain power structures. Some kinds of
                overt hate speech may rouse a response from our leaders, but those who employ a
                more subtle approach are permitted their voice. Thus, both progressive speech
                and hate speech are permitted within a carefully regulated framework of power
                preservation.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Some topics, however, remain strictly forbidden.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Our community has persistent and pervasive problems of a particular sort
                which
                we are not allowed to talk about: sexual harassment and assault. Men who
                assault, harass, and even rape women in our spaces, are protected. A culture of
                silence is enforced, and those who call out rape, sexual assault, or harassment,
                those who criticise they who enable and protect these behaviors, are punished,
                swiftly and aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Men are terrified of these kinds of allegations. It seems like a life
                sentence:
                social ostracization, limited work opportunities, ruined relationships. We may
                have events in our past that weigh on our conscience; was she too drunk, did she
                clearly consent, did she regret it in the morning? Some of us have events in our
                past that we try not to think about, because if we think too hard, we might
                realize that we crossed the line. This fills men with guilt and uncertainty, but
                also fear. We know the consequences if our doubts became known.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;So we lash out in this fear. We close ranks. We demand the most stringent
                standards of evidence to prove anything, evidence that we know is not likely to
                be there. We refuse to believe that our friends were not the men we thought they
                were, or to confront that we might not be ourselves. We demand due process under
                the law, we say they should have gone to the police, that they can&amp;rsquo;t make
                accusations of such gravity without hard proof. Think of the alleged
                perpetrator; we can&amp;rsquo;t ruin their lives over frivolous
                accusations.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;For victims, the only recourse permitted by society is to suffer in
                silence.
                Should they speak, victims are subject to similar persecutions: they are
                ostracized, struggle to work, and lose their relationships. They have to manage
                the consequences of a traumatic experience with support resources which are
                absent or inadequate. Their trauma is disbelieved, their speech is punished, and
                their assailants walk free among us as equals while they are subject to
                retaliatory harassment or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Victims have no recourse which will satisfy men. Reporting a crime is
                traumatic,
                especially one of this nature. I have heard many stories of disbelief from the
                authorities, disbelief in the face of overwhelming evidence. They were told it
                was their fault. They were told they should have been in a different place, or
                wearing something else, or should have simply been a different person.
                It&amp;rsquo;s
                their fault, not the aggressor&amp;rsquo;s. It&amp;rsquo;s about what they, the
                victim, should
                have done differently, never mind what the perpetrator should have done
                differently. It&amp;rsquo;s estimated that less than 1% of rapes end with the rapist
                in
                jail&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref"
                role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;ndash; the remainder go
                unreported, unprosecuted or fail after years of
                traumatic legal proceedings for the victims. The legal system does not provide
                justice: it exacerbates harm. A hacker will demand this process is completed
                before they will seek justice, or allow justice to be sought. Until then, we
                will demand silence, and retaliate if our demands are not met.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The strict standards of evidence required by the justice system are there
                because of the state monopoly on violence: a guilty verdict in a crime will lead
                to the imprisonment of the accused. We have no such recourse available in
                private, accordingly there is no need to hold ourselves to such standards. Our
                job is not to punish the accused, but rather to keep our communities safe. We
                can establish the need to take action to whatever standard &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt;
                believe is
                sufficient, and by setting these standards as strict as the courts we will fail
                to resolve over 99% of the situations with which we are faced &amp;ndash; a standard
                which is clearly not sufficient to address the problem. I&amp;rsquo;m behind you if
                you
                want to improve the justice system in this regard, but not if you set this as a
                blocker to seeking any justice at all. What kind of hacker puts their faith in
                authority?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I find the state of affairs detestable. The hypocrisy of the free speech
                absolutist who demands censorship of challenging topics. The fact that the
                famous hacker curiosity can suddenly dry up if satisfying it would question our
                biases and preconceptions. The complicity of our moderators in censoring
                progressive voices in the defense of decorum and the status quo. The duplicitous
                characterization of &amp;ldquo;polite&amp;rdquo; hate speech as acceptable in our
                communities. Our
                failure to acknowledge our own shortcomings, our fear of seeing the
                &amp;ldquo;other&amp;rdquo; in a
                position of power, and the socially enforced ignorance of the
                &amp;ldquo;other&amp;rdquo; that
                naturally leads to failing to curtail discrimination and harassment in our
                communities. The ridiculously high standard of evidence we require from victims,
                who simply ask for our &lt;em&gt;belief&lt;/em&gt; at a minimum, before
                we&amp;rsquo;ll consider doing
                anything about their grievance, if we could even be convinced in the first
                place.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the problems that these forbidden topics seek to discuss are
                present
                in our community. That includes the &amp;ldquo;polite&amp;rdquo; problems, such as
                the conspicuous
                lack of diversity in our positions of power, which may be discussed and
                commiserated only until someone suggests doing something about it; and also the
                impolite problems up to and including the protection of the perpetrators of
                sexual harassment, sexual assault, and, yes, rape.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Most hackers live under the comfortable belief that it
                &amp;ldquo;can&amp;rsquo;t happen here&amp;rdquo;, but
                it can and it does. I attended a hacker event this year &amp;ndash; HiP Berlin
                &amp;ndash; where I
                discovered that some of the organizers had cooperated to make it possible for
                multiple known rapists to participate, working together to find a way to
                circumvent the event&amp;rsquo;s code of conduct &amp;ndash; a document that they
                were tasked with
                enforcing. One of the victims was in attendance, believing the event to be safe.
                At every hacker event I have attended in recent memory, I have personally
                witnessed or heard stories of deeply problematic behavior and protection for its
                perpetrators from the leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Our community has problems, important problems, that every hacker should
                care
                about, and we need the bravery and humility to face them, not the cowardice to
                retaliate against those who speak up. Talk to, listen to, and believe your peers
                and their stories. Stand up for what&amp;rsquo;s right, and speak out when you see
                something that isn&amp;rsquo;t. Demand that your leaders and moderators do the right
                thing. Make a platform where people can safely speak about what our community
                needs to do right by them, and have the courage to listen to them and confront
                yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;You need to be someone who will &lt;em&gt;do something about
                it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;hr&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;: Case in point: this post was quietly
                removed by Hacker News moderators
                within 40 minutes of its submission.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Hyprland is a toxic community</title>
            <link>https://drewdevault.com/2023/09/17/Hyprland-toxicity.html</link>
            <pubDate>Sun, 17 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <guid>https://drewdevault.com/2023/09/17/Hyprland-toxicity.html</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hyprland.org/"&gt;Hyprland&lt;/a&gt; is an
                open source Wayland compositor based on &lt;a
                href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots"&gt;wlroots&lt;/a&gt;, a
                project I started back in 2017 to make it easier to build good Wayland
                compositors. It&amp;rsquo;s a project which is loved by its users for its emphasis
                on
                customization and &amp;ldquo;eye candy&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; beautiful graphics and
                animations, each
                configuration tailored to the unique look and feel imagined by the user who
                creates it. It&amp;rsquo;s a very exciting project!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the effect is spoilt by an incredibly toxic and hateful
                community. I cannot recommend Hyprland to anyone who is not prepared to steer
                well clear of its community spaces. Imagine a high school boys&amp;rsquo; locker
                room come
                to life on Discord and GitHub and you&amp;rsquo;ll get an idea of what
                it&amp;rsquo;s like.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I became aware of the issues with Hyprland&amp;rsquo;s community after
                details of numerous
                hateful incidents on their Discord came to my attention by way of the
                grapevine. Most of them stem from the community&amp;rsquo;s tolerance of hate:
                community
                members are allowed to express hateful views with impunity, up to and including
                astonishing views such as endorsements of eugenics and calls for hate-motivated
                violence. Such comments are treated as another act in the one big inside joke
                that is the Hyprland community &amp;ndash; the community prefers not to take itself
                &amp;ldquo;too
                seriously&amp;rdquo;. Hate is moderated only if it is
                &amp;ldquo;disruptive&amp;rdquo; (e.g. presents as
                spam), but hate presented with a veneer of decorum (or sarcasm) is tolerated,
                and when challenged, it&amp;rsquo;s laughed off as a joke.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In one particular incident, the moderators of the Discord server engaged in
                a
                harassment campaign against a transgender user, including using their moderator
                privileges to edit the pronouns in their username from
                &amp;ldquo;they/she&amp;rdquo; to
                &amp;ldquo;who/cares&amp;rdquo;. These roles should be held by trusted community
                leaders, and it&amp;rsquo;s
                from their behavior that the community&amp;rsquo;s culture and norms stem
                &amp;ndash; they set an
                example for the community and define what behaviors are acceptable or expected.
                The problem comes from the top down.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Someone recently pitched a code of conduct &amp;ndash; something that this
                project sorely
                needs &amp;ndash; in a &lt;a
                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230917015135/https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/issues/3209"&gt;GitHub
                issue&lt;/a&gt;. This thread does not have much overt hate, but
                it does clearly show how callous and just plain &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt; the
                community is,
                including its leadership (Vaxerski is the original author of Hyprland).
                Everything is a joke and anyone who wants to be &amp;ldquo;serious&amp;rdquo; about
                anything is
                mercilessly bullied and made fun of. Quoting this discussion:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I think [a Code of Conduct] is pretty discriminatory towards people that
                prefer a close, hostile, homogeneous, exclusive, and unhealthy community.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;First of all, why would I pledge to uphold any values? Seems like just
                inconveniencing myself. [&amp;hellip;] If I&amp;rsquo;d want to moderate,
                I&amp;rsquo;d spend 90% of the
                time reading kids arguing about bullshit instead of coding.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t know how to behave without a wall of text explaining
                how to
                behave online then you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be online.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I am not someone who believes all projects need a code of conduct,
                &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; there
                exists a reasonable standard of conduct in its absence &amp;ndash; and that means
                having
                a community that does not bully and harass others for expressing differing
                points of view, let alone for simply having a marginalized identity.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I would have preferred to address these matters in private, so I reached
                out to
                Vaxry in February. He responded with a lack of critical awareness over how
                toxicity presents in his community. However, following my email, he put out a
                poll for the Discord community to see if the community members experienced
                harassment in the community &amp;ndash; apparently 40% of respondents reported such
                experiences. Vaxry et al implemented new moderation policies as a result. But
                these changes did not seem to work: the problems are still present, and the
                community is still a toxic place that facilitates bullying and hate, including
                from the community leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Following my email conversation with Vaxry, he appeared on &lt;a
                href="https://invidious.mnus.de/watch?v=nskemNa_Kn4"&gt;a podcast&lt;/a&gt; to
                discuss toxicity in the Hyprland community. This quote from the interview
                clearly illustrates the attitude of the leadership:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;[A trans person] joined the Discord server and made a big deal out of their
                pronouns [..] because they put their pronouns in their nickname and made a big
                deal out of them because people were referring to them as &amp;ldquo;he&amp;rdquo;
                [misgendering
                them], which, on the Internet, let&amp;rsquo;s be real, is the default. And so, one
                of the moderators changed the pronouns in their nickname to
                &amp;ldquo;who/cares&amp;rdquo;. [&amp;hellip;]
                Let&amp;rsquo;s be real, this isn&amp;rsquo;t like, calling someone the N-word or
                something.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Later he describes a more moderated community (the /r/unixporn discord
                server)
                as having an environment in which everyone is going to &amp;ldquo;lick your butthole
                just
                to be nice&amp;rdquo;. He compared himself to &lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_A._Davis"&gt;Terry Davis&lt;/a&gt;, the
                late operating system
                developer whose struggles with mental illness were broadcast for the world to
                see, citing a video in which he answers a phone call and refers to the person on
                the phone by the N-word &amp;ldquo;ten times&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Vaxry compares
                this to his approach to
                answering &amp;ldquo;stupid questions&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It really disappoints me to see such an exciting project brought low by a
                horribly mismanaged community of hate and bullying. Part of what makes open
                source software great is that it&amp;rsquo;s great for everyone. It&amp;rsquo;s
                unfortunate that
                someone can discover this cool project, install it and play with it and get
                excited about it, then join the community to find themselves at the wrong end of
                this behavior. No one deserves that.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I empathise with Vaxry. I remember being young, smart,
                productive&amp;hellip; and mean. I
                did some cool stuff, but I deeply regret the way I treated people. It
                wasn&amp;rsquo;t
                really my fault &amp;ndash; I was a product of my environment &amp;ndash; but it was
                my
                responsibility. Today, I&amp;rsquo;m proud to have built many welcoming communities,
                where
                people are rewarded for their involvement, rather than coming away from their
                experience hurt. What motivates us to build and give away free software if not
                bringing joy to ourselves and others? Can we be proud of a community which
                brings more suffering into the world?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My advice to the leadership&lt;/strong&gt; begins with taking
                a serious look in the mirror.
                This project needs a &amp;ldquo;come to Jesus&amp;rdquo; moment. Ask yourself what
                kind of community
                you can be proud of &amp;ndash; can you be proud of a community that people walk
                away
                from feeling dejected and hurt? Yours is not a community that brings people joy.
                What are you going to do about it?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A good start will be to consider the code of conduct proposal seriously,
                but a
                change of attitude is also required. &lt;a href="mailto:sir@cmpwn.com"&gt;My
                inbox&lt;/a&gt; is open to any of the
                leaders in this project (or any other project facing similar problems) if you
                want to talk. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to chat with you in good faith and help you
                understand
                what&amp;rsquo;s needed and why it&amp;rsquo;s important.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To members of the &lt;strong&gt;Hyprland community&lt;/strong&gt;, I want
                each of you to personally step
                up to make the community better. If you see hate and bullying, don&amp;rsquo;t stay
                silent. This is a community which proclaims to value radical free speech: test
                it by using your speech to argue against hate. Participate in the community as
                you think it should be, not as it necessarily is, and change will follow. If you
                are sensitive to hate, or a member of a marginalized group, however, I would
                just advise steering clear of Hyprland until the community improves.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If the leadership fails to account for these problems, it will be up to the
                community to take their activity elsewhere. You could set up adjacent
                communities which are less toxic, or fork the software, or simply choose to use
                something else.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To the &lt;strong&gt;victims of harassment&lt;/strong&gt;, I offer my
                sincere condolences. I know how
                hard it is to be the subject of this kind of bullying. You don&amp;rsquo;t deserve
                to be
                treated like this. There are many places in the free software community where
                you are welcome and celebrated &amp;ndash; Hyprland is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the
                norm. If you need
                support, I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;a href="mailto:sir@cmpwn.com"&gt;always
                available&lt;/a&gt; to listen to your struggles.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To everyone else: please share this post throughout the Hyprland community
                and
                adjacent communities. This is a serious problem and it&amp;rsquo;s not going to
                change
                unless its clearly brought to light. The Hyprland maintainers need to be made
                aware that the broader open source community does not appreciate this kind of
                behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I sincerely hope that this project improves its community. A serious
                attitude
                shift is needed from the top-down, and I hope for the sake of Vaxry, the other
                leaders, and the community as a whole, that such change comes sooner rather than
                later. When Vaxry is older and wiser, I want him to look back on the project and
                community that he&amp;rsquo;s built with pride and joy, not with regret and
                shame.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;hr&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I was also privately provided some of the enusing discussion from the
                Hyprland
                Discord. Consider that this lacks context and apply your grain of salt
                accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I apologise to Vaxry for interrupting their rest, and wish them a speedy
