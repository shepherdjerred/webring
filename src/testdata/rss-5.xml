Reader mail is the only thing that brings me joy in this cruel world of spreadsheets and sprints: ludicity.hackernews@gmail.com, but will take a while to reply after the deluge of emails following the AI post. I do read everything.

I will prioritize responding if:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You live in Melbourne and want coffee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are a student seeking advice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are an unemployed engineer that shares my values who needs help, especially from marginalized communities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to invite me onto a podcast or something because the flames of my ego are a roaring inferno that needs constant feeding, to the dismay of all those around me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Podcast which is just me chatting with readers and friends, get those famous clout-chasers outta here.

Mastodon because it's so much nicer than Twitter.

Twitter which only exists so that I can comment on posts whenever I'm featured on a podcast, which is not a sentence I ever expected to type.

This Escalated Quickly&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned one post ago that this blog has done approximately 2M+ lifetime views, with over a million of them being in the past two weeks in response to the now-infamous &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-will-fucking-piledrive-you-if-you-mention-ai-again/"&gt;rant about AI&lt;/a&gt;, then I went out of my way to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; write the most maximally viral thing possible for personal don't-be-a-clickbaiting-grifter&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; reasons. But to say that the blog has done a lot of traffic is actually a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; understatement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been understating the madness of the last few weeks because it took me a while to even figure out if it was a flash in the pan or something that is just my life now. I don't have any experience with how blog posts should do, so I genuinely didn't know if a million hits was "pretty good" or "Jesus Christ". On the previous occasions that my writing has done well, that merely resulted in getting enough email that I had to dedicate a few hours of time to reply to all of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; time around, it's just at a whole new level. My anonymity is totally gone. I have 318 unread emails, maybe another 500 lengthy messages on LinkedIn (which, despite the medium, are all thoughtful). I've joked before about making the Clout Number that is LinkedIn followers go up to terrorize empty suits, but I now have &lt;em&gt;three thousand&lt;/em&gt; even though the only way to find me on LinkedIn is to &lt;em&gt;navigate to my homepage, to the About Me, then to my profile&lt;/em&gt;. Do you know &lt;em&gt;how much work&lt;/em&gt; that is in internet terms? There are companies that could 5x their revenue by removing that many steps from finding the purchase button. The worst part is that it's all wasted on me, I don't even know what you do with LinkedIn followers, so I've just been mocking people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="LinkedIn_Post.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/ffb8f1bc.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend Stephen Deutsch once told me to proceed by the light of the bridges I'm burning. He was joking but I've realized that my greatest weakness is that I can't stop myself from taking advice, even bad advice, if it sounds witty enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been on &lt;a href="https://www.iheart.com/podcast/139-better-offline-150284547/episode/i-will-piledrive-you-if-you-191631096/"&gt;an episode of Better Offline&lt;/a&gt; with Ed Zitron and Robert Evans. Zitron called me cool on air, which is now going to be the first line of my CV for the rest of my life. There are episodes inbound of Screaming in the Cloud, the MLOps Community podcast, Byte Marx, the Joe Reis&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Show, and 1984 Today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TIME magazine has asked me to provide a quote on AI influencers. I don't even know if that's a big deal — I only see people talk about them when they put Putin and Hitler on the front cover, which I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; is only funny in hindsight, but this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; hindsight so it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; funny. I know this might reek of hubris, but I think I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; pick a hundred people in a row and miraculously end up with no fascists, hit me up if you'd like tips. Also, having now read the quality of tech journalism out there to prepare for interviews, the temptation to start sinking the industry's battleships by just doing their job better is very strong (though the journalist from TIME, Rebecca Schneid, was a delightful conversation partner and clearly phenomenally intelligent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another magazine, affiliated with an institution that took A$12,000 from me when I was immigrating to rubber stamp that I'm a certified software engineer, reached out for a quote on an anti-AI piece, and I got to send them this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate you reaching out, and the piece sounds good! Unfortunately, I do have some familiarity with the [ORG], and it was all related to how the organization extracts money from immigrants (read: me) to rubber stamp their I.T credentials during the [COURSE ON EMAIL WRITING FOR FILTHY FOREIGNERS]. Also between the two of us, the only [ORG] members I've met in the workplace have been ancient demi-liches with minimal talent held together by nothing but grift and willingness to commit political violence. Blink twice (or email me from a personal address) if they're holding you hostage.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't worked out if I have a media policy yet, but suffice it to say that "don't work with the [ORG]" is probably part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This did not actually do anything to recoup my losses, the journalists were not personally to blame outside of working for an organization that &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; did some sneaky inside deals with a politician&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and realistically this was simply throwing away a chance at seeming more important than I actually am, but &lt;em&gt;fuck it&lt;/em&gt;, we didn't get here by compromising. Proceed as you intend to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also there is something incredibly funny about watching people &lt;em&gt;very carefully&lt;/em&gt; thank you for your time without acknowledging anything else in the email because their true feelings might be used against them by the decrepit poltergeists that haunt the executive suites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am slated to give a talk at GDG Melbourne, demo it on Primagen's Twitch channel before the big day, and am hoping to give another talk at &lt;a href="https://dddperth.com/"&gt;DDD&lt;/a&gt; alongside noted absolute unit &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU0B0ZGUaaI"&gt;Stefan Prandl&lt;/a&gt;. And there's another talk that I'm thinking about attending in Vegas in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also going to appear as a voice of anti-LLM reason in a documentary, which will finally convince my extremely conservative father that I have not tanked my career by going too hard. Despite what grifters would like you to think, if you aren't from a &lt;em&gt;hypermarginalized&lt;/em&gt; community it is very difficult to go too hard, and you'll know you're there when you wake up in a cold sweat with a half-assembled molotov clutched in your hands. Disclaimer: This advice may not apply in the U.S, where I have heard that in many states you can be fired for so much as thinking that the boss has made a mistake at any point in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone has shipped me an early copy of their to-be-released book in case the &lt;em&gt;possibility&lt;/em&gt; of a review might drive traffic to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, I woke up and an editor reached out to offer me the opportunity to get a book published, which I am &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; going to accept after doing some due diligence on what to look for in a publisher, which includes such wonderful phrases as "free rein", "no rush", and "please don’t dropkick me"&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I'm trying to say is that &lt;em&gt;things have escalated extremely quickly&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-the-mad-pathway-to-get-here"&gt;II. The Mad Pathway To Get Here&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite authors, Nassim Taleb, is huge on the idea that the real world is pure chaos, and the incorrect belief that it isn't merely leads to people blundering constantly. The rough idea is that you want to maximize the areas of your life that are exposed to opportunity, preferably the kind that you can decline if the opportunity sucks. That is to say, don't hang out in a dark room all day, every day, if you're looking to live an exciting life. I live much of my life with that principle in mind, and point myself in an approximately nice-looking direction then accept that I'll end up somewhere totally different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know this blog was &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be about how to run fantasy tabletop RPGs effectively? Ludic isn't an inversion of lucid as most people guess, it means &lt;em&gt;relating to play&lt;/em&gt; and is a reference to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludic_fallacy"&gt;Taleb's ludic fallacy&lt;/a&gt;, which is the misapplication of simplistic game systems to the complexity of the real world. There's still a post in draft sitting at 5.5K words that I estimated would be finished at &lt;em&gt;50K&lt;/em&gt; which is mostly about how to be a good Game Master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, I wrote a blog post about my experience studying undergraduate psychology&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which did a thousand views on the first day. It was critical of epistemic and quality issues with how the field is approached at the undergraduate level. At the time, I had just graduated near the top of a major Australian university's Honours course, which tend to be hyper-competitive, not due to difficulty in the course material, but due to the fact that this is the main pathway to the very prestigious profession of clinical psychologist. Between us, as is a recurring theme on this blog, it was not actually very hard. Most of the other students refused to open their textbooks or start assignments the day before they were due. I was also interviewing to become a clinical neuropsychologist at the University of Melbourne, which I didn't succeed at &lt;em&gt;but even getting an interview as an international student is hard as hell&lt;/em&gt;. Plus I had tested most of my theories about the dysfunction of the university system by starting a small statistics tutoring business, where I showed students how to weaponize psychology &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; unserious academics. It did well enough that I probably could have filled my 9 to 5 with students if I had wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So of course, the internet being the internet, a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/a1raex/comment/eat1fje/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button"&gt;very smart person on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; accused me of secretly failing, and then another genius insisted that I'm &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/a1raex/comment/eathpw1/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button"&gt;probably a Scientologist&lt;/a&gt;. Some people do not merely have smooth brains, they pride themselves on running their minds through an industrial QCM-SRP1300 Wide Belt Sander every morning. Then, amidst a swirling cloud of mangled neurons, they will insist that &lt;em&gt;ackshually&lt;/em&gt; you're in a cult. Perish, dorks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all you need to understand about why it is totally okay &lt;em&gt;not to care&lt;/em&gt; what some people think. Namely, that some people &lt;em&gt;do not think&lt;/em&gt; under any reasonable definition of the word. One of the funniest things that David Gerard told me when I started writing is that I can probably afford to be bold, because he survived tussling with Scientologists for real, which permanently blew out his threat detector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/terry_pratchett_600502"&gt;There are some people who hate my guts. But that goes with the territory.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I changed the headline of that blog to "very little in terms of intellectual content", because &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/compliments/"&gt;you've got to laugh or you'll cry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I never really followed up on that writing success. This is going to sound &lt;em&gt;incredibly dumb&lt;/em&gt;, but I got so caught up trying to figure out how the website should &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; that I averaged a year between posts, before finally taking the website down because I didn't have a permanent work visa and was unexpectedly working with psychologists. I didn't want to find out if they had a self-reflective sense of humour and appreciation for epistemology the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote another small piece on Taleb's narrative fallacy, which &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; did a few hundred views immediately, but I once again failed to follow up. If there's a lesson here for readers, it's that you can generate an audience &lt;em&gt;very consistently&lt;/em&gt; even though luck is a major factor in how each individual piece goes. And also that you should be smarter than me and actually keep writing instead of getting stunlocked by font choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While slaving over a chapter describing the game theory of lying to your players about what you rolled, I had a very frustrating day at work. I can't even remember what happened. I suspect someone just talked about Agile a little bit too much as I desperately begged them to understand that 0% test coverage is a problem. Since the blog already existed, I took two hours to knock out an article where I lamented that most of my work in the tech space seemed like it was being thrown away, as a total afterthought chucked in onto Hackernews, then went to bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon waking up, I was greeted by the startling knowledge that it had been #1 on Hackernews, something that &lt;em&gt;seemed like it might be a big deal&lt;/em&gt; but I had no real way of knowing if it was a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept writing this time because I had chosen this precise platform because it was marketed as having no settings to mess with. Readership gradually built up, and currently &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; post in the backlog does between 200-500 hits &lt;em&gt;per day&lt;/em&gt;, up from 10 per day last February. I have met a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of astounding people that are on the same spiritual wavelength as me, and was pretty happy for this state of affairs to persist. &lt;em&gt;Just&lt;/em&gt; enough attention to maybe give a fun talk at some point, maybe get a few job opportunities at nice companies, possibly generate a lead or two for consulting with the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I wrote a rant about AI which I expected to do 20K views, and now I'm worrying about how to tell if a printed book is going to have decent quality before signing with a publisher. Page feel is very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-why-me"&gt;III. Why Me?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had to think deeply on whether I should accept all the attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the recurring jokes in David Edding's &lt;em&gt;Belgariad&lt;/em&gt; is that characters, especially young ones, will ask the ancient sorcerer Belgarath &lt;em&gt;why they were chosen for something&lt;/em&gt;, which alternates between frustrating the hell out of the old man and amusing him to no end. There is, of course, no point in asking "Why me?" because life just happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought when most of this kicked off was, and I cannot emphasize this enough, I am some random guy with five years of industry experience who &lt;em&gt;happens to be good at writing&lt;/em&gt;. Writing skill is not totally uncorrelated with aptitude for a field, but only insofar as you must &lt;em&gt;genuinely&lt;/em&gt; have intuition for a field's underlying principles in order to draw links between areas to produce novelties. This is a complicated way of saying "I'm a better writer than I am a programmer", and the immediate temptation is to pass on the attention for fear of being in over one's head. So, why me? Well... because. That's all, because. I have Eddings to thank for being at peace with that answer. Things just happen when you put yourself out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I do have some more sophisticated thoughts on &lt;em&gt;why me&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is that I now view all fields as consisting of a bimodal distribution, which is how nerds say there are two types of people. That is, there is a huge clump of people that have not studied, have no particular talent for the thing they do professionally, but have nonetheless drifted into the field because it was a default. Some of the worst offenders I know in corporate settings are phenomenal parents or talented artists, and they do just do office work because it's easy to default into with no effort. Remember all those people that really wanted to get into HR at university? No? That probably explains why HR, real estate agents, and recruiters all seem largely disengaged in a way that is shocking to the rest of us. You'll hear people handwave this and say it's fine because they're just earning a living, and that's true until you realize that they work in hospitals and burn the billions of dollars necessary to compensate nurses respectfully. It's understandable, justifiable, and even I've benefited from those jobs, but it isn't &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every single person I've spoken to in the past two weeks, from all industries, has quietly conceded that most of their field is run by people that have no business doing so. Don't panic, but this includes doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I know many people that are much smarter and wiser than me, I at least &lt;em&gt;have opinions&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;try hard&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt;. I've self-certified myself as not being totally incompetent, which I know is a bold move in 2024, where everyone is encouraged to be maximally humble at all times to provide struggling psychologists with an endless supply of imposter syndrome work.&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Sincerely trying makes you good enough to be refreshing in a world that is filled by what my friend Courtney Brandabur calls "microphone guys". They just get the microphone and won't shut the fuck up even though we'd all like them too. Every night before bed, they gargle the words "innovation" and "alignment" until they're soaked in disgusting grifter saliva. The world isn't starved for my dubious engineering talent, it's starved for someone that can write decently, understands the fundamentals of the craft, and &lt;em&gt;most importantly&lt;/em&gt; is willing to say risky things. I know this horrid state of affairs is true because otherwise &lt;em&gt;someone with more experience would have been picked&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, my writing is obviously inflammatory. That makes for good listening. On Zitron's podcast, I accused Agile of being so many layers of terrible copying away from the original manifesto that "we're on Kamino but the clones have eight heads".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, grifters have &lt;em&gt;such a comprehensive stranglehold&lt;/em&gt; on the global corporate stage that the world is dying for someone to just say what we can all see. I can &lt;em&gt;see the wishful thinking happening&lt;/em&gt;. It is very, very easy to transmute yourself into a thought leader. If I had lied and said my company did a hundred million dollars in revenue this year, journalists would have accepted it totally uncritically because they &lt;em&gt;want it to be true&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of people who shared my writing described me as an "expert data scientist" and an "industry leader".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expert data scientist, that's &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; true, I'll concede, but I'm well out of practice and only talk about a university competition I cleaned up in. And, of course, people who &lt;em&gt;actually &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/breaking-my-universitys-machine-learning-competition/"&gt;read the linked article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; will note that I cleaned up via normal computer science, not machine learning! Ya boy even wins his AI competitions without using AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry leader, on the other hand, that's just wishful thinking. People &lt;em&gt;want me to be an industry leader&lt;/em&gt; because they're craving an authority figure to confirm their feelings, but I &lt;em&gt;don't run enough analytics to know if I am&lt;/em&gt;, so how could &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; know that? All my traffic could be Bobby "F5" Johnson from Rockford, Illinois, who compulsively refreshes every page on this blog a thousand times a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that aside — much of that isn't a great reason to have a platform — it's clear to me that there's an opportunity to do something good. Grifters and hype will always exist, but loudly pushing back against those egos and bubbles is valuable work. More importantly, it's something that I'm uniquely positioned to do that other people can't right now, no matter how good they are at software engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received an &lt;em&gt;astonishing&lt;/em&gt; amount of correspondence from non-technicians who tolerated by Postgres and try/catch jokes simply because they were so, so tired of hearing clowns tell them that ChatGPT is going to replace their jobs. The very dweebs who gloat about LLMs revolutionizing society &lt;em&gt;are the ones on the chopping block&lt;/em&gt; and they're trying to scare &lt;em&gt;other people&lt;/em&gt;. The first people to go &lt;em&gt;will be Deloitte consultants&lt;/em&gt; because LLMs are very good at emitting bullshit — that's not their only use case, but it's obviously their &lt;em&gt;main one&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me ask everyone in the audience this, both technical and non-technical — what is harder &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;? Getting ChatGPT to produce a &lt;em&gt;passable&lt;/em&gt; strategy for a large business, or getting artificial intelligence to navigate meatspace to fix someone's plumbing? Given the answer, do you think &lt;em&gt;plumbers&lt;/em&gt; are going out of work before people that make Gantt charts for a living? I am going to spend a year repeating this question to every dickhead that brings this up, preferably on stages in front of large audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, I would be dishonest if I didn't admit this was a major factor, I've been having a lot of fun with the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-what-now"&gt;IV. What Now?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What now? This is the thing that I've been wrestling with over the past two weeks. It is becoming apparent that the attention will quiet down, but not enough for opportunities to stop cropping up. My main goal for the year, which was simply to ship one web app for blog readers to play around with to a standard that my mentors approve of, is probably off the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; thing is that I have to make sure those talks are good as I can make them. I'll make posts here as they come out in case people are interested. I'm estimating that it will take take &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; an hour per minute going into each talk, and that's because some of the audiences are small. I'm delivering between 30 and 120 minutes of talk by the end of the year, so there's going to be some serious hustling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I have to make sure that I somehow find some time to study —  I've slacked on this while handling everything, and haven't seriously made email headway. A platform without matching self-development is one of the fundamental manifestations of grifting, alongside TED talks and being rewarded with speaking engagements after purchasing enterprise software. Plus, you &lt;em&gt;can't write well&lt;/em&gt; without reading widely, and I must make some time for that too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, of course, writing a book, possibly two. This is something that I've wanted to do since I was old enough to distress my Southeast Asian parents by naming careers that weren't doctor and lawyer. However, I was expecting to self-publish for a readership of, let me check those core demographics, my mother. Instead, it looks like I'm going to have one fiction book being self-published and something else aimed at the technology sector specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've decided not to even try to writing full-time. I sincerely believe this would cause the quality of my writing to suffer, as any writer needs a certain amount of contact with reality to continue producing meaningful content, and lounging around the house all day writing is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; sufficient contact for the type of thing I write about. I &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; try this if a career in fiction writing takes off, but that would address a completely different audience, and we honestly have no clue if I'm any good at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I am seriously considering a six to twelve month sabbatical from my part-time job in order to clear time for technical study&lt;sup id="fnref:7"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and getting those books done. This is very expensive for me, but the current moment feels like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I still have &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/Ludic190"&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.liberapay.com/Ludic/"&gt;Liberapay&lt;/a&gt; and shows of support are always appreciated, but I cannot emphasize this enough, &lt;em&gt;it will not increase my writing output&lt;/em&gt;, and I have sufficient savings to survive the sabbatical. I've received somewhat mixed advice on this, with Ed Zitron noting that it probably helps to &lt;em&gt;mention&lt;/em&gt; it's possible to support me, and Corey Quinn noting that it leaves a bad taste in the mouth for readers to feel like they're being shaken for money. The worst part is that both of those things sounds right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've stuck the links up above, and I'll add some disclaimers. Supporting me through either channel &lt;em&gt;will not make me write more&lt;/em&gt; —  I write when the inspiration hits me, and I can't force more out for money while keeping quality. This blog will never be paywalled, the podcast is not paywalled with no plans to change this, and I intend to earn my living from programming for spiritual reasons and to avoid audience capture — the day that my lived experience totally diverges from that of the reader is probably the day that I stop writing. The only reason to chuck a few dollars in is to reassure me that people like my work enough to help me if my writing makes me unemployable at large companies, which I have been warned is already happening. Previously readers would say that they'd give me an internal referral but hide the blog in case it upset their managers, but this is obviously no longer actually possible. I still don't know if the typical company would welcome me for my values or if they're too worried about the consequences of to inviting the grifter's apex predator into food chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All future Patreon/Liberapay plugs will only happen once a year because I still find them distasteful, starting July 2025. And, because this probably matters to the engineers in the audience, Liberapay takes a much smaller share then Patreon &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; is committed to supporting free and open-source software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My podcast may run an ad read or two if I find a sponsor with a product that I actually like, as I'm now busy enough that editing them is actually an ordeal. I'm not sure what this would actually mean, because the only tech products that have given me nothing but warm fuzzy feelings in recent memory are &lt;a href="https://www.reaper.fm/"&gt;REAPER&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.zsa.io/moonlander"&gt;ZSA Moonlander&lt;/a&gt;, and they &lt;em&gt;are right now&lt;/em&gt; getting plugged on my largest platform for free. Uh, I don't know anything about this, hit me up if you know how to get ethical podcast sponsors, I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v"&gt;V.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to recap, it's all pretty straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just have to prepare for two talks, fly to meet readers in Europe, get Australian citizenship so I can do a 2025 speaking engagement in Vegas, be in a documentary, handle a few more podcast episodes, keep producing my &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; podcast, ship the application that'll get me into software Valhalla, complete books such as &lt;em&gt;How Linux Works&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Writing a Compiler in Go&lt;/em&gt;,  write a fiction &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a non-fiction book, deal with the business coming to my consultancy, take care of my girlfriend who is currently dealing with Covid isolation, prepare for a theater performance in December, practice my first student performance for my music school, give career advice to all the students that reached out, try out my first journalism gig for a major U.S publication, get a coffee every weekday in the city with a reader, try to connect everyone that emailed me with someone in their local area who can help them with their job searches, and keep interviewing for good day jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh fu—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hackernews moderation suspected that I was &lt;em&gt;trying to write clickbait&lt;/em&gt;, but I was actually doing my best &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to. Adding the word "fucking" to a title historically &lt;em&gt;reduces&lt;/em&gt; traffic because of being flagged for profanity. I only used it because the naming pattern from my previous rants was more important to me than views. You can see HN moderator dang's analysis &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40735538"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and while dang is genuinely awesome, this is such a delightfully engineer-brained (pejorative) take. An optimized clickbait title would have &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; been something like "I am going to personally burst the AI bubble and there will be no survivors". XOXO still love you, dang.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just realized &lt;em&gt;while writing this&lt;/em&gt; that this must be the same Joe Reis that wrote &lt;em&gt;Fundamentals of Data Engineering&lt;/em&gt;, so, you know, wow.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I'm Malaysian, my &lt;em&gt;grandfather&lt;/em&gt; was bribing cops well into his 70s. I can trace the corruption like a bloodhound.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No idea how to pick an editor, but I know a sense of humor when I see one.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've saved this to republish one day, so everyone can see how much my writing has changed over a few years.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:6"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is entirely serious, but the thing I receive &lt;em&gt;the most criticism for&lt;/em&gt; is daring to take a position &lt;em&gt;between&lt;/em&gt; "I am the worst engineer on the planet" and "I am the reincarnation of Grace Hopper". Most of the people who ask me for advice are clearly in the top 5% of competence but think they're in the bottom 20%. If you're bothering to worry if you're bad then you're &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:6" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:7"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may sound strange to &lt;em&gt;leave work&lt;/em&gt; to get better at engineering, but I still have not found an employer in Melbourne that hits the trifecta of currently hiring, being known to me, and having engineers that I want to learn from, though I've seen a million places that hit two of those requirements.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:7" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/my-glorious-ascension-to-thought-leadership/</guid></item><item><title>On Burnout, Mental Health, And Not Being Okay</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/on-burnout-mental-health-and-not-being-okay/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This blog did so many hits last week that the host platform experienced timeouts. I've been invited onto podcasts, and offered both small technical projects and &lt;em&gt;journalism&lt;/em&gt; work, of all things. It was a crazy time. But the internet moves on, as it always does, and I am left, as we all always are, to figure out what to write about next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thread that runs through the emails I get is, surprisingly, one about mental health, though I didn't recognize it as such at first. Consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found your blog today and, Jesus Christ, reading it made me feel sane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first few times I received emails like this, I thought of them &lt;em&gt;purely&lt;/em&gt; as commentary on how out of place people feel when they're surrounded by the strange dysfunction that descends upon most organizations. But then &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; people write in to tell me that they're burned out after going through the above for long enough, which gives the whole thing a much more concerning overtone. One meeting too many and now they can't work — they feel terrible because office work is so much easier than manual labour, but &lt;code&gt;brain.exe has stopped responding&lt;/code&gt;. Students write in to talk about how they're terrified of what happens after university, which is obviously somewhat comical to those of us who have graduated and realized that only a tiny fraction of the population cares about university performance&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but probably doesn't feel so fun for the student. Trans people talk about struggles with homelessness and unemployment. For some people, a good start is "I don't feel like dying today".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's just the people that write in. With a &lt;em&gt;million&lt;/em&gt; hits last week, someone that laughed at my dumb rant is fighting cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a point in &lt;em&gt;my life&lt;/em&gt; where I ended every day in the dark, staring at a wall for an hour or two straight, trying to figure out why everything felt awful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what I want to write about, perhaps to the disappointment of the crowd that might want another rant, is that everyone at some point in their life will be Not Okay. It will be you, your parents, your partner, your friends. Any and all of them. There is a day, in the past, future, or present, where you will be Not Okay to a degree that is unfathomable. And, from personal experience, no matter how it feels at this very second, three things are true:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might get better no matter how hopeless it seems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's nothing to be ashamed of&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's Okay to be Not Okay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i"&gt;I.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to share my experience, because I can't tell people not to be ashamed of what they're going through if I don't do it first. Remember: I am not anonymous, I am not independently wealthy, and people I know &lt;em&gt;at real workplaces&lt;/em&gt; read this blog now. Some of them are industry leaders&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; who will be understandably upset that I have suggested that LLM obsession and talking about Agile all day are signs of incompetence, and they have real power over me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had three run-ins with burnout and serious mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I was studying my fourth year of psychology at an Australian university. The research facility I was at had a policy of assigning unpaid students to 11PM to 5AM shifts, presumably because we were meant to &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; participate in the research process, but it was probably because they were trying to avoid paying technicians penalty rates for working at night. Some people are motherfuckers, what can I say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface, I was a phenomenal student. I made work look easy enough to make other students jealous, professors were ecstatic I was at their lab, and my grades were solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, there was nothing to be jealous about. I shouldn't have pretended to be okay, and made my peers feel inferior in a bid to prop up my failing health with an ego boost. Between the stress of writing a minor thesis, &lt;em&gt;intense&lt;/em&gt; sleep deprivation, and the self-esteem of a 20 year old that grew up in Southeast Asia, I was a shell of a person by the end of that year. Within the first three months, it was not uncommon for me to undergo extreme mood swings, reduced to weeping for upwards of an hour in the evenings for no reason that I could discern. At the time it really felt like I might &lt;em&gt;die&lt;/em&gt; from sadness — it was unfathomable to believe that a person could feel that &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; indefinitely without something vital breaking — and there really seemed to be no cause. I didn't know how to get treatment, coming from a country where therapy is for "crazy" people, so I just kept quiet about it for the whole year. I only sought a psychologist in the last two weeks so that I could get an extension on my thesis, which I could no longer even look at without panicking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after getting my thesis through the door, and starting to get sleep again, I reached some semblance of normalcy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second time happened a few years later, in early 2019. It was quite severe. I was nearing the end of my Masters thesis in data science, and feeling extremely overwhelmed. Coming from a social science background, I was extremely underconfident when it came to both my mathematical skill and programming, a situation not helped by somehow landing the most technical minor theses out of my whole cohort — I had a book titled &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-387-27656-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Statistical and Inductive Inference by Minimum Message Length&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; open for a lot of the year. Again, my previous qualification dedicated a whole week to the fact that you can make dogs drool on command. I was &lt;em&gt;not having a good time&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stress crept up a little bit, day by day, until one day I just didn't eat without noticing. I have no idea what happened, because I really felt &lt;em&gt;mostly fine&lt;/em&gt; the day before. Overnight, everything fell apart. I would awaken with this deep core of dread, so intense it was physically uncomfortable, and no amount of adjusting pillows can help with something that is entirely endogenous. I was possessed by a deep-seated feeling that nothing would be okay ever again, and there was just no &lt;em&gt;point&lt;/em&gt; to anything. I'd try to sleep for as long as possible, because waking up meant going back to the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By that weekend, I was staying with family, completely unable to care for myself. It took three days to go from a top-performer to being unsure if I'd  have wasted away without help. I found a psychologist who was superior to the first, but was still barely able to help me with anything more than a few breathing exercises. Every day, my aunt would convince me to get out of bed, blessedly nag me until I ate &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, and I would watch Brooklyn 99 all day because it tuned out the worst feelings until I was allowed to sleep again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day I noticed that I felt a little bit better around 9PM. And the next day it was 8:40PM. Then 8:20PM, like clockwork. Maybe it was some weird circadian thing, but I'll never know. Each day I just held on desperately, trying to grind out a measly hundred words of my thesis per day, wanting to die, praying that I would feel &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; again. And I kept getting better, until one day I woke up at 8AM, felt bad until 8:10AM, finished my thesis, and binged Pathfinder: Kingmaker to celebrate being human again. Neutral Good Human Ranger, and trash fantasy has never felt so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things were pretty good for a while after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, the third and worst time — the one that eventually resulted in this blog and changing my life entirely. It started around the beginning of Covid, but it has been festering for a while. I was still working at my first Australian job, but a few things didn't feel quite right — I clued in very quickly to the fact that it was largely cosplaying at responsibility. Management was constantly embarrassing themselves with confident opinions on things they clearly had no experience with, doing their best to win status games, and otherwise forcing me to spend a lot of time on work that shouldn't exist, like figuring out why our team's database had fields labelled &lt;em&gt;primary key&lt;/em&gt; but no actual primary keys. For the non-technicians out there, I can only compare this to a hospital having a hundred bottles labelled &lt;code&gt;morphine&lt;/code&gt; that are, in point of fact, filled with water, and no one knew for years until I checked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, I cruised for a bit, enjoying a first world salary before little issues cropped up. Management let my contract lapse for two weeks, and renewed it on the condition I agree to do a web development project I was totally unqualified for. I like honesty, but I also love not being deported and not being extorted, so I agree, then leave as soon as I can. At this point I'm already not feeling great, and had to pair this all with navigating Australia's extortionate immigration process. Plus the organization had  &lt;em&gt;laid off the only engineer helping me&lt;/em&gt;, mostly because he quietly did his job instead of talking to management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grabbed another job as quickly as possible to avoid my contract lapsing &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;, but management is a whole other level of toxic. Each day, I was locked into a tiny grey box in a dreary office, which runs &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; too hot 24/7 because there's a massive computer in there that we used for building neural networks. I undergo the events described in &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/flexible-schemas-are-the-mindkiller/"&gt;Flexible Schemas Are The Mindkiller&lt;/a&gt;. Management says they won't renew my visa unless I pinky promise to stay for years, so I make the promise, then &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; I leave for my mental health. The millionaire CEO calls me to personally threaten me, at a point in my life where I couldn't tell if I had just ruined my career or if he was blustering. And to top it all off, I was locked indoors for a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was at this point that it started to fall apart more catastrophically than ever. I was very, very lucky to have the money to afford a good psychologist, and to &lt;em&gt;randomly blunder&lt;/em&gt; into someone I believe to be one of the best therapists in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day I'd wake up with that same pit of despair that life was pointless, certainly &lt;em&gt;partially&lt;/em&gt; informed by the stresses of immigration and workplaces that didn't align with my values, but some of it was just awful brain chemistry striking from nowhere. It only got &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; when I solved the immigration problem, because I realized everything was still mostly the same and now I had no reason to believe things would change as soon as my permanent residency cleared. Though this sounds stupid now, I really felt that the only thing the future had in store for me was commuting, staring blankly at a screen, cramming in two hours of "fun" knowing that I'd have to do it all again until I retired. I hated everything about my lifestyle, even how I chose to spend my time off work. It was almost all entirely irrational, but it got worse and worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On several nights, the only thing that would make me feel even a &lt;em&gt;bit&lt;/em&gt; better would be to turn all the lights off in my room, sit on the floor, and stare at a wall in the dark, in silence, sometimes for an hour straight. I'd wake up at 3AM with nightmares on many nights, and would sometimes wander my suburb at 5AM in a call with a friend. I could barely enjoy walks in daylight because even tossing a stranger an offhanded smile felt like I was expending all of my "lie that things are okay" budget for the day. I had to start working three days a week because pretending to care about weekly status updates was so taxing. At several points, I experienced suicidal ideation, meaning that I was &lt;em&gt;genuinely&lt;/em&gt; in such dire straits that I started to think that dying would be better than struggling on with no end in sight, though I thankfully never made any plans to this effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My memory of all of this is quite hazy, as if it happened to someone else. The only real window I have left into this period of my life is The Book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The_Book (Small).jpg" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/aabc9e04.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a particularly bad day, I was seized by the urge to get the feelings &lt;em&gt;out of my head&lt;/em&gt;, and I figured that onto a page might be okay. So I bought the nicest journal that I could find on the off-chance that'd make me feel a shred better, and I started to write every day. Frequently multiple times a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't opened The Book in years until today, because there is nothing between those covers but something verging on madness. The little leather string is always drawn taut, because it makes me feel like whatever is in there will not leak out. I will not share the any contents verbatim because they are too personal. Within a single day, I would swing from feeling better, to self-flagellating over not practicing the piano, to thinking that there was no point to life, to appreciating a conversation with a friend, to obsessing over my diet. It reads like a raging current of insanity from a disturbed mind. Within two months, I had run two pens dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffice it to say &lt;em&gt;I was not well&lt;/em&gt;. I kept a few pages blank at the very end, symbolically, because one day I will be unwell again, either due to bad luck, or grieving, or regular physical illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was at my worst, I told my brother that things had been going badly. Well, I tried to. I believe I knocked on his door, got as far as "I thought I should tell you that things have been —" and then choked up. He's had his own struggles, worse than mine, so he hugged me and said "It's Okay to be Not Okay".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that's the exact moment that I started to get better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-getting-better"&gt;II. Getting Better&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will tell you you can't sleep alone in a strange place&lt;br&gt;
Then they'll tell you can't sleep with somebody else&lt;br&gt;
Ah but sooner or later you sleep in your own space&lt;br&gt;
Either way it's O.K. you wake up with yourself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone gets better in their own way, and at the risk of being trite, goes through their own journey. And I was lucky enough to have a problem that disappeared with enough therapy and lifestyle change — not everyone does. That journey may look like more madness at some points, and indeed, may &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; more madness. A friend of mine who is going through an awful breakup recently texted me that the secret to their current incredible physique is that they, quote, "no longer allow myself to take any pleasure in food", which I understand because I did the same thing but &lt;em&gt;holy shit&lt;/em&gt; that looks horrifying from the fortunate perspective of my newfound health. But maybe that's just part of our path back to happiness. Which I cannot emphasize enough, does not mean that you should strive to make it your path to happiness, because that is a &lt;em&gt;fucked up&lt;/em&gt; thing to say and I can't believe I ever endorsed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first few times I was ill, it just went away on its own. The &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; time, the most serious, I threw everything I had at it, because I knew it was that or a life that was worse than death. Something about the direness of the situation unlocked a capacity that I didn't know I had. I figured if I was going to be clinically depressed, I should at least try everything so that I knew it was justified — and after all, if I was going to wallow then I didn't want to feel like I hadn't &lt;em&gt;earned&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got into the best shape of my life, hitting the gym almost every morning. I ate exactly 1,200 calories per day, comprised of nothing more than chicken breast and salad basically every meal. It was disgusting and concerned my therapist greatly, but it didn't bother me at all since I was experiencing total anhedonia anyway. There was certainly an overtone of engaging in societally acceptable self-harm. I'd lift weights listening to the most furious music I could, leaving me with the permanent damage of enjoying D12 to this day. I'd be in the gym at 5:30AM some days to avoid looking too much like a man in crisis near other humans. I went from 84 kilograms and in dreadful shape to 68 kilograms squatting something like 1.3x my body weight, though there wasn't a shred of pleasure in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I signed up for music classes, &lt;em&gt;purely&lt;/em&gt; because it was something I hadn't tried before, and I figured I might as well check it off the list before my heart gave out from despair. I found that playing scales made me feel slightly better, so I'd sometimes sit at my window hitting random keys for indeterminate periods of time, no doubt looking like a madman to everyone that passed by my window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I signed up for improvised theater classes despite never doing anything like that in my life because fuck it, why not? If I'm going to be miserable at home, why not be miserable and embarrassed in public?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached out to &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; friend I had, not because I wanted to, but because that's what you're supposed to do. I either had an hour long call with someone or met up in-person every single day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I summoned reserves that I never imagined I had access to in a million years, and despite that, to this day the only things that I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; had an impact were pure wretched stubbornness and therapy. And I cannot emphasize this enough, if that sounds at all admirable, it &lt;em&gt;was not&lt;/em&gt;. There is nothing dignified or gratifying in that kind of suffering — I would occasionally leave a gym session so livid that I probably would have started a fight if I got hassled in public, which is a deeply ugly thing to harbor in your personality. I throw out hyperbolic threats in rants so easily &lt;em&gt;precisely&lt;/em&gt; because anyone who knows me in real life knows that I don't aspire to physical violence. Only communicative violence, where I slowly build up the political reserves to end the careers of individual grifters one at a time, like the Punisher but he kills people with Tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Think about how sick I must have been&lt;/em&gt;. The thing I am most looking forward to in this world is ordering &lt;em&gt;Cosmic Encounter&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cosmic Alliance&lt;/em&gt; from my local board game store so that I can run a full-day game with my improvised theater group, who will be working on an improvised musical with me this semester. &lt;em&gt;Read that sentence then try and tell me I'm qualified for street fights&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only ray of hope throughout the whole ordeal was the knowledge that, despite the fact I really felt things were totally hopeless, &lt;em&gt;I was obviously mad&lt;/em&gt; and thus in no position to judge whether things were hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just kept &lt;em&gt;grinding&lt;/em&gt;, and each day I became a little bit more human, and now I have the capacity to take care of other people again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever fixes it in the end, it's going to be different for you. There are more qualified people than me to talk about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to get better. I'll just give the boring, obvious, &lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; advice, and hope that anyone who needs it has the ability and the reserves to action at least &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; help to get out of bed no matter how much that sounds awful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise, even a little bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read and watch uplifting things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find a good therapist&lt;/em&gt;, and accept that you may have to try several — the median therapist is as bad as the median programmer or real estate agent, and this is too important to add fifty caveats about how they're doing their best so that dipshits on Reddit don't get angry. Be prepared to &lt;em&gt;ditch them within two sessions&lt;/em&gt; if you aren't making progress, but be more conservative if you're someone with strong "therapy is bullshit" feelings going in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you find a therapist, don't hold back. They can't help you if you do — a shocking number of my friends don't risk vulnerability in sessions then complain it isn't working&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your friend has a good therapist that is unavailable, &lt;em&gt;ask that therapist who their most competent friends in the field are&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach out to people and spend time with them — let them know you are Not Okay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, and perhaps most importantly, in terms of "this advice doesn't get given enough", but sometimes you have to make big lifestyle changes. Huge ones. The default advice is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to take risks, not because it's generally good advice, but largely because they don't want to be responsible for you quitting a job and ending up homeless &lt;em&gt;which is a real thing that can happen&lt;/em&gt;. But they'll happily tell you to hedge yourself to death. Some people genuinely have no choice about their current circumstances, but a &lt;em&gt;shocking&lt;/em&gt; number of people become suicidal about situations that they can &lt;em&gt;just leave&lt;/em&gt; if only their perspective wasn't so skewed by illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know how many readers reach out to me to complain about workplace-induced depression, then reveal that they've &lt;em&gt;almost started&lt;/em&gt; looking for new work? &lt;em&gt;Almost starting&lt;/em&gt; isn't going to make you feel better, &lt;em&gt;mon ami&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-it-happens-to-everyone"&gt;III. It Happens To Everyone&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many students have reached out to me in the past week, asking for career advice. I think they were expecting Python books&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Sorry kids, you're getting this instead, and one day I hope you'll understand that this is the best career advice I can possibly give you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing about a million people — they have one million problems. One million people sums to approximately a million instances of chemotherapy, divorces, bullying, funerals, layoffs, depression, anxiety, gender dysphoria, trauma, and PowerPoints that are due by Thursday. Someone who reads this blog doesn't know if they're going to live long enough to finish &lt;em&gt;A Song of Ice and Fire&lt;/em&gt;. Someone who reads this blog thinks they will, but they will not. No one gets through life unscathed. Them's the breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might obviously have a lot of disdain for people that make the world worse with the lack of care in their work, but I still appreciate that they're going through something. Almost everyone that was a dickhead to me during the immigration process is presumably a reasonable parent to their children. The worst workplace bully I've ever seen struggles with crippling self-esteem issues. Some of the most clueless executives I've ever met take care of their families and have to deal with their parents passing away. I get it. No one gets a pass to an easy life, so everyone gets some baseline empathy.&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first manager in Australia, now leading a huge team and working for big piles of money, told me that they ended up in some dark places in their late 20s. The senior administrator on my first team has been on stress-related leave for almost three years. Every single person at my own company has had either depression or anxiety, and supported me through my own, though it isn't my place to tell their stories for them. When I &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/the-million-dollar-curtain-pull-with-simon-swords/id1737204926?i=1000659693487"&gt;interviewed Simon Swords&lt;/a&gt; on my podcast, a literal millionaire who could easily pass himself off as a lifelong success story, he admitted that he had days where he just played video games and ate pizza while his wife tried to help pick up the pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone approached me after a talk once, when I was still at university, and sincerely said &lt;em&gt;they wished they could be me&lt;/em&gt; because of their crippling stage fright, and the fact that I seemed like I had it all under control. Some years after that, I went to a tiny conference in Adelaide and swept &lt;em&gt;literally all&lt;/em&gt; the undergraduate research awards available away from the other four students who were presenting. What those students didn't know is that I was in the midst of that sleep-deprivation crisis. Before speaking, I had locked myself in the bathroom for ten minutes and cried until I couldn't anymore. It was gross too, not at all like a cool movie scene where the tortured performer presumably shows you the depths of his anguish before revealing his brilliance. There was a lot of shaking hands, snot, and retching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen a fencer that clearly had some intense stuff going on break down crying after getting eliminated from a huge competition, and at that &lt;em&gt;same competition&lt;/em&gt; I saw a woman win the finals, weeping openly, because she was informed that her long-suffering father had passed away quietly in hospital while she waited to start the round. Life can be great and it can also be a carnival of misery, and we all have free tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is going to happen. It just is. There's no getting around it, and there's nothing to be ashamed of. Some days you will lose and cry as if it's the end of the world. Some days you will win a fencing competition and still be down a father. Some days you will not be able to get out of bed for longer than it takes to pick up the trash you just ordered on UberEats. Some days, hopefully, things will be pretty all right. I work with an engineer who was once homeless and exposed to what they once called fear-cold-hunger, but they're safe now. Either way, it's Okay to be Not Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-caring"&gt;IV. Caring&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ooh, each morning I get up I die a little&lt;br&gt;
Can barely stand on my feet&lt;br&gt;
Take a look at yourself in the mirror and cry&lt;br&gt;
Lord, what you're doing to me?&lt;br&gt;
I have spent all my years in believin' you&lt;br&gt;
But I just can't get no relief, Lord  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somebody (Somebody)&lt;br&gt;
Ooh, somebody (Somebody)&lt;br&gt;
Can anybody find me&lt;br&gt;
Somebody to love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm here today because people cared enough to get me through everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been better than fine for two years now, and the only thing that has consistently worked in the long-term has been taking care of myself and caring about things. I started writing because I actually &lt;em&gt;cared&lt;/em&gt; that my work was being thrown away by complicit rogues, even though that made me sadder in the short-term than not caring. I kept writing because I felt some things needed saying, and I responded to every email (until now when it's basically impossible due to volume) because I cared that people were bothering to write in. I started a business because no one would pay me to do work with care built in as an employee, only to do work good enough to get someone a promotion. I make my girlfriend breakfast every morning because I care that being a veterinary surgeon is harder than my job, and I buy five types of greens for my rabbit every week because I care about him too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should be bee-lining for Thought Leader status, but I'm spending &lt;em&gt;more time studying&lt;/em&gt; than capitalizing on the temporary fame because I care about representing our profession well. I care so much at times that it's probably a little bit demented. I mean, obviously, or I'd just accept an exorbitant software engineering salary and keep my mouth shut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Also, sometimes I don't care just because I need a break. No amount of admonishment or money will make me fiddle with another PowerBI dashboard and I'm not keeping up with politics, okay? I've got &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt; going on.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caring sometimes means making drastic changes to bring you closer to things to care about. I gave up a huge amount of my income to have more free time. I have a friend that flew to Spain on almost no notice to spend a year and &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of his money recovering. Another that fled the city entirely so that he can spend most of his time rock climbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take as much caring as you can get. It's fine. Pay it forward when you can. Try to give more than you take in the long-run, but it's okay if you don't. It's okay to be angry, or sad, or to feel nothing at all even when you think you should. Take it from someone that expresses all of that and has to deal with &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/compliments/"&gt;the internet being the internet&lt;/a&gt;. Just help one person at a time, as unscalable as that approach is, even when that one person is you. I certainly can't do it all myself, but collectively we can make a dent, one problem at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would be really, really surprised what things end up getting people through their worst days. When I still fenced at the university, we had one fifteen year old student, and I'd hang around after class to keep them company until their mother could pick them up at 10 PM. Last year, their mother told me that this had been an extra kindness that helped them juggle two kids as a single mother, one of whom was transitioning. I had no idea, I just lived across the road and liked their company. I got through the worst depression of my life watching a YouTuber do &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQahsBowqYk&amp;amp;list=PLCTCQ7PeSckLJw2rz3kS0FwCmewIz4UTS"&gt;challenge runs of Runescape&lt;/a&gt;, which the author no doubt thought was just a stupid thing he was doing in his free time, but it &lt;em&gt;genuinely alleviated&lt;/em&gt; the most extreme suffering of my life better than any SSRI in existence could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone, somewhere, has made my life better by choosing &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to write terrible code that I had to debug in my darkest moments, and I'll never even know about it. But you know, thanks for the little things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose that's all I have to say for now. We'll get back to our regularly scheduled programming soon, but it didn't seem quite right to follow the last posts with something that made any concessions at all to popularity. I just hope it helped someone feel a little bit better.&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll end on a quote from Robert Pirsig's &lt;em&gt;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&lt;/em&gt;, who went through some very serious loss but stuck by this sentiment, even though it took him many years to get back there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so we ride on and on, down through Ukiah, and Hopland, and Cloverdale, down into the wine country. The freeway miles seem so easy now. The engine which has carried us halfway across a continent drones on and on in its continuing oblivion to everything but its own internal forces. We pass through Asti and Santa Rosa, and Petaluma and Novato, on the freeway that grows wider and fuller now, swelling with cars and trucks and busses full of people, and soon by the road are houses and boats and the water of the Bay.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trials never end, of course. Unhappiness and misfortune are bound to occur as long as people live, but there is a feeling now, that was not here before, and is not just on the surface of things, but penetrates all the way through: We've won it. It's going to get better now. You can sort of tell these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And those people are fucking dweebs for the most part.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kind that accept panel invitations to talk about technology despite not actually knowing what Python &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, fine &lt;em&gt;Fluent Python&lt;/em&gt; by Luciano Ramalho, but you'd better read the rest of this, and don't ever say I never did nuthin' for ya.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I threaten to kill people &lt;em&gt;quickly&lt;/em&gt; when they grift.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you're in a place where optimism is infuriating, I'd like to apologize, I've been there too.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

it is the one down the hall,&lt;br&gt;
past the cubicles and dreary faces,&lt;br&gt;
uplifted only when He deigns to venture forth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You will know Him when you see Him,&lt;br&gt;
He is the one composed,&lt;br&gt;
of a thousand writhing forms,&lt;br&gt;
of a thousand professions,&lt;br&gt;
and a thousand colours,&lt;br&gt;
though mostly white, between the two of us.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multitudinous is Synergy Greg!&lt;br&gt;
As He offers you a stiff drink,&lt;br&gt;
Flickering from man to woman to enbi,&lt;br&gt;
but mostly a man, between the two of us.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;His handshake grinds the bones of the world,&lt;br&gt;
and in the ruins of the pines,&lt;br&gt;
the other lays cable for high-frequency trades,&lt;br&gt;
it's just good business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beneficent is Synergy Greg!&lt;br&gt;
He has nothing against "the transes"!&lt;br&gt;
Fortune has conspired to keep them,&lt;br&gt;
from this august body,&lt;br&gt;
plus you know what they're like,&lt;br&gt;
as He drinks a bit too much,&lt;br&gt;
at the office party.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;His lungs are mighty bellows,&lt;br&gt;
swallowing ten imported cigars in one great pull,&lt;br&gt;
which He pretends to enjoy,&lt;br&gt;
and billowing forth a cloud of motivation,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Go Team! Get! Shit! Done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He will wait by the sidelines,&lt;br&gt;
cheering you on,&lt;br&gt;
and preparing for His TED talk.&lt;br&gt;
The call is coming.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Any day now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;His minions are manifold and wise,&lt;br&gt;
they will see about that raise,&lt;br&gt;
they understand that you have children,&lt;br&gt;
but Greg must find place in the budget,&lt;br&gt;
alongside the yacht.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Synergy Greg has all the Secrets of Business,&lt;br&gt;
It is Quantum,&lt;br&gt;
And Crypto,&lt;br&gt;
And Blockchain,&lt;br&gt;
And GenAI,&lt;br&gt;
And Faustian,&lt;br&gt;
Let us coin an NFT in His image,&lt;br&gt;
hallelujah!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Synergy Greg is self-made,&lt;br&gt;
don't dare you dare say otherwise.&lt;br&gt;
He bought Bitcoin early,&lt;br&gt;
his dad owns the company,&lt;br&gt;
and if you're so smart, why aren't you rich?&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benevolent is Greg!&lt;br&gt;
He'd love to hire you!&lt;br&gt;
If you were just more technical.&lt;br&gt;
A real shame,
He needed more women!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forgiving is Greg!&lt;br&gt;
He'd love to hire you!&lt;br&gt;
He needs a personal assistant,&lt;br&gt;
under thirty,&lt;br&gt;
blonde,&lt;br&gt;
busty,&lt;br&gt;
wait, don't write those down.&lt;br&gt;
He needed more women!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diverse is Greg!&lt;br&gt;
He loves immigrants!&lt;br&gt;
They help with the margins,&lt;br&gt;
and let Him misspell their names,&lt;br&gt;
and don't ask questions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just keep the brown,&lt;br&gt;
and black,&lt;br&gt;
and Chinese-y ones,&lt;br&gt;
(Don't be that way -&lt;br&gt;
You know what He means),&lt;br&gt;
away from management.&lt;br&gt;
They don't understand our culture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Busy is Greg!&lt;br&gt;
He does not have time for books,&lt;br&gt;
but He dabbles in blogs,&lt;br&gt;
by which He means magazines,&lt;br&gt;
by which He means LinkedIn,&lt;br&gt;
by which He means nothing.&lt;br&gt;
Could you summarize this poem for Him?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Down-To-Earth is Greg,&lt;br&gt;
and He walks in many guises,&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why is His food taking so long?&lt;br&gt;
He'd like to speak to the manager.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And He has rostered you for Saturday,&lt;br&gt;
don't put that on your timesheet.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And why do they hate the office?&lt;br&gt;
He's so happy to see everyone again.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And it's an unpaid internship,&lt;br&gt;
be grateful, kid.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And you aren't a team player,&lt;br&gt;
get on side or get out.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And no one wants to work anymore,&lt;br&gt;
He says at the leadership retreat.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And He's sad to announce layoffs,&lt;br&gt;
consoling Himself with a bonus.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And employees used to be loyal,&lt;br&gt;
better tenants, too.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And nurses should not strike,&lt;br&gt;
just on the principle of the thing.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And medical patents don't pay for themselves,&lt;br&gt;
don't disincentivize His compassion.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And you can't prove it's carcinogenic,&lt;br&gt;
He doesn't even know where to hire a hitman.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And the village is in the way,&lt;br&gt;
trade offer: ashes for your history.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And He wants you to lift those bricks with your back,&lt;br&gt;
Insurance will cover the emotional damage,&lt;br&gt;
to your children.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He will burn through ten imported workers in one great pull,&lt;br&gt;
which He'll pretend not to enjoy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And above all,&lt;br&gt;
don't you ever fuck with Him.&lt;br&gt;
Do you even know who He is?&lt;br&gt;
You'll never work in this town again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Great is Synergy Greg!&lt;br&gt;
Magnificent is Synergy Greg!&lt;br&gt;
Raise me to Heaven,&lt;br&gt;
Or just give me a Raise!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is he gone?&lt;br&gt;
Are you sure?&lt;br&gt;
Check the door,&lt;br&gt;
He lurks sometimes,&lt;br&gt;
because your data belongs to Him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He's gone?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Between the two of us,&lt;br&gt;
I fucking hate that guy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to apologize to any readers called Greg.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/synergy-greg/</guid></item><item><title>I Will Fucking Piledrive You If You Mention AI Again</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-will-fucking-piledrive-you-if-you-mention-ai-again/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The recent innovations in the AI space, most notably those such as GPT-4, obviously have far-reaching implications for society, ranging from the utopian eliminating of drudgery, to the dystopian damage to the livelihood of artists in a capitalist society, to existential threats to humanity itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I myself have formal training as a data scientist, &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/breaking-my-universitys-machine-learning-competition/"&gt;going so far as to dominate a competitive machine learning event at one of Australia's top universities&lt;/a&gt; and writing a Master's thesis where I wrote all my own libraries from scratch in MATLAB. I'm not God's gift to the field, but I am &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; better than most of my competition - that is, practitioners like myself who haven't put in the reps to build their own C libraries in a cave with scraps, but can read textbooks, implement known solutions in high-level languages, and use libraries written by elite institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is with great regret that I announce that the next person to talk about rolling out AI is going to receive a complimentary chiropractic adjustment in the style of Dr. Bourne, i.e, I am going to fucking break your neck. I am truly, deeply, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i-but-we-will-realize-untold-efficiencies-with-machine-l-"&gt;I. But We Will Realize Untold Efficiencies With Machine L-&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the &lt;em&gt;fuck&lt;/em&gt; did I just say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started working as a data scientist in 2019, and by 2021 I had realized that while the field was &lt;em&gt;large&lt;/em&gt;, it was also &lt;em&gt;large&lt;/em&gt;ly fraudulent. Most of the leaders that I was working with clearly had not gotten as far as reading about it for thirty minutes despite insisting that things like, I dunno, the next five years of a ten thousand person non-tech organization should be entirely AI focused. The number of companies launching AI initiatives far outstripped the number of &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; use cases. Most of the market was simply grifters and incompetents (sometimes both!) leveraging the hype to inflate their headcount so they could get promoted, or be seen as thought leaders&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money was phenomenal, but I nonetheless fled for the safer waters of data and software engineering. You see, while hype is &lt;em&gt;nice&lt;/em&gt;, it's only nice in small bursts for &lt;em&gt;practitioners&lt;/em&gt;. We have a few key things that a grifter does not have, such as job stability, genuine friendships, and &lt;em&gt;souls&lt;/em&gt;. What we do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have is the ability to trivially switch fields the moment the gold rush is over, due to the sad fact that we actually need to study things and build experience. Grifters, on the other hand, wield the omnitool that they self-aggrandizingly call 'politics'&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. That is to say, it turns out that the core competency of smiling and promising people things that you can't actually deliver is &lt;em&gt;highly transferable&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left the field, as did most of my smarter friends, and my salary continued to rise a reasonable rate and &lt;em&gt;sustainably&lt;/em&gt; as I learned the wisdom of our ancient forebearers. You can hear it too, on freezing nights under the pale moon, when the fire burns low and the trees loom like hands of sinister ghosts all around you - when the wind cuts through the howling of what you &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; is a wolf and hair stands on end, you can strain your ears and barely make out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Just Use Postgres, You Nerd. You Dweeb."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data science jobs began to evaporate, and the hype cycle moved on from all those AI initiatives which failed to make any progress, and started to inch towards data engineering. This was a signal that I had both predicted correctly &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; that it would be time to move on soon. At least, I thought, all that AI stuff was finally done, and we might move on to actually getting something accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then some absolute son of a bitch created ChatGPT, and &lt;em&gt;now look at us&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Look at us&lt;/em&gt;, resplendent in our pauper's robes, stitched from corpulent greed and breathless credulity, spending half of the planet's engineering efforts to add chatbot support to every application under the sun when half of the industry hasn't worked out how to test database backups regularly. This is why I have to visit untold violence upon the next moron to propose that AI is the future of the business - not because this is impossible &lt;em&gt;in principle&lt;/em&gt;, but because they are now &lt;em&gt;indistinguishable&lt;/em&gt; from a hundred million willful fucking idiots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-but-we-need-ai-to-remain-comp-"&gt;II. But We Need AI To Remain Comp-&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweet merciful Jesus, stop talking. Unless you are one of a tiny handful of businesses who know &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what they're going to use AI for, you &lt;em&gt;do not need AI for anything&lt;/em&gt; - or rather, you do not need to do anything to reap the benefits. Artificial intelligence, as it exists and is useful now, is probably &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; baked into your businesses software supply chain. Your managed security provider is probably using some algorithms baked up in a lab software to detect anomalous traffic, and here's a secret, &lt;em&gt;they didn't do much AI work either&lt;/em&gt;, they bought software from the tiny sector of the market that actually &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; need to do employ data scientists. I know you want to be the next Steve Jobs, and this requires you to get on stages and talk about your innovative prowess, but none of this will allow you to pull off a turtle neck, and even if it &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt;, you would need to replace your sweaters with fullplate to survive my onslaught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the fact that most companies are unable to successfully develop and deploy the simplest of CRUD applications on time and under budget. This is a &lt;em&gt;solved problem&lt;/em&gt; - with smart people who can collaborate and provide reasonable requirements, a competent team will knock this out of the park &lt;em&gt;every single time&lt;/em&gt;, admittedly with some amount of frustration. The clients I work with now are all like this - even if they are totally non-technical, we have a mutual respect for the other party's intelligence, and then we do this crazy thing where we &lt;em&gt;solve problems together&lt;/em&gt;. I may not know anything about the nuance of building analytics systems for drug rehabilitation research, but through the power of &lt;em&gt;talking to each other like adults&lt;/em&gt;, we somehow solve problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most companies can't do this, because they are operationally and culturally crippled. The median stay for an engineer will be something between one to two years, so the organization suffers from institutional retrograde amnesia. Every so often, some dickhead says something like "Maybe we should revoke the engineering team's remote work privile - whoa, wait, why did all the best engineers leave?". Whenever there is a ransomware attack, it is revealed with clockwork precision that no one has tested the backups for six months and half the legacy systems cannot be resuscitated - something that I have personally seen &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;four fucking years&lt;/em&gt;. Do you know how &lt;em&gt;insane&lt;/em&gt; that is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most organizations cannot ship the most basic applications imaginable with any consistency, and you're out here saying that the best way to remain competitive is to roll out &lt;em&gt;experimental technology&lt;/em&gt; that is an order of magnitude more sophisticated than anything else your I.T department runs, which you have no experience hiring for, when the organization has &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; used a GPU for anything other than junior engineers playing video games with their camera off during standup, and &lt;em&gt;even if you do that all right&lt;/em&gt; there is a chance that the problem is simply unsolvable due to the characteristics of your data and business? This isn't a recipe for disaster, it's a cookbook for someone looking to prepare a twelve course fucking catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about you &lt;em&gt;remain competitive&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;em&gt;fixing your shit&lt;/em&gt;? I've met a lead data scientist with access to hundreds of thousands of sensitive customer records who is allowed to keep their password in a text file on their desktop, and you're worried that customers are best served by using AI to improve security through some mechanism that you haven't even come up with yet? You sound like an &lt;em&gt;asshole&lt;/em&gt; and I'm going to kick you in the jaw until, to the relief of everyone, a doctor will have to wire it shut, giving us ten seconds of blessed silence where we can &lt;em&gt;solve actual problems&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-weve-already-seen-extensive-gains-from-"&gt;III. We've Already Seen Extensive Gains From-&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was younger, I read R.A Salvatore's classic fantasy novel, &lt;em&gt;The Crystal Shard&lt;/em&gt;. There is a scene in it where the young protagonist, Wulfgar, challenges a barbarian chieftain to a duel for control of the clan so that he can lead his people into a war that will save the world. The fight culminates with Wulfgar throwing away his weapon, grabbing the chief's head with bare hands, and &lt;em&gt;begging&lt;/em&gt; the chief to surrender so that he does not need to crush a skull like an egg and become a murderer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well this is me. Begging you. To stop lying. I don't want to crush your skull, I really don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But I will if you make me&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I was shown &lt;a href="https://scale.com/ai-readiness-report#section-download"&gt;Scale's "2024 AI Readiness Report"&lt;/a&gt;. It has this chart in it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Scale Report.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/6687b89a.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How &lt;em&gt;stupid&lt;/em&gt; do you have to be to believe that only &lt;em&gt;8%&lt;/em&gt; of companies have seen failed AI projects? We can't manage this consistently with CRUD apps and people think that this number isn't laughable? &lt;em&gt;Some&lt;/em&gt; companies have seen benefits during the LLM craze, but not &lt;em&gt;92%&lt;/em&gt; of them. 34% of companies report that generative AI &lt;em&gt;specifically&lt;/em&gt; has been assisting with strategic decision making? What the actual fuck are you talking about? GPT-4 can't even write coherent Elixir, presumably because the dataset was too small to get it to the level that it's at for Python&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and you're admitting that you outsource your decisionmaking to &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1diljf2/google_gemini_tried_to_kill_me/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;the thing that sometimes tells people to brew lethal toxins for their families to consume&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;? What does that even &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't believe you. No one with a brain believes you, and if your board believes what you just wrote on the survey then they should fire you. I finally understand why some of my friends feel that they &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to be in leadership positions, and it is because someone needs to wrench the reins of power from your lizard-person-claws before you drive us all collectively off a cliff, presumably insisting on the way down that the current crisis is best remedied by additional SageMaker spend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine was invited by a FAANG organization to visit the U.S a few years ago. Many of the talks were technical demos of impressive artificial intelligence products. Being a software engineer, he got to spend a little bit of time backstage with the developers, whereupon they revealed that &lt;em&gt;most of the demos were faked&lt;/em&gt;. The products didn't work. They just hadn't solved some minor issues, such as &lt;em&gt;actually predicting the thing that they're supposed to predict&lt;/em&gt;. Didn't stop them spouting absolute gibberish to a breathless audience for an hour though! I blame not the engineers, who probably tried to actually get the damn thing to work, but the lying blowhards who insisted that they must make the presentation or presumably be terminated&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another friend of mine was reviewing software intended for emergency services, and the salespeople were not expecting someone handling purchasing in emergency services to be a hardcore programmer. It was this false sense of security that led them to &lt;em&gt;accidentally reveal that the service was ultimately just some dude in India&lt;/em&gt;. Listen, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; would just be some random dude in India if I swapped places with some of my cousins, so I'm going to choose to take that personally and point out that &lt;em&gt;using the word AI as some roundabout way to sell the labor of people that look like me to foreign governments&lt;/em&gt; is fucked up, you're an unethical monster, and that if you continue to &lt;code&gt;try { thisBullshit(); }&lt;/code&gt; you are going to &lt;code&gt;catch (theseHands)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-but-we-must-prepare-for-the-future-of-"&gt;IV. But We Must Prepare For The Future Of-&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to ask ChatGPT how to prepare a garotte and then I am going to strangle you with it, and you will simply have to &lt;em&gt;pray&lt;/em&gt; that I roll the 10% chance that it freaks out and tells me that a garotte should consist entirely of paper mache and malice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see executive after executive discuss how they need to immediately roll out generative AI in order to prepare the organization for the future of work. Despite all the speeches sounding exactly the same, I know that they have rehearsed extensively, because they manage to move their hands, speak, and avoid drooling, all at the same time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's talk seriously about this for a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in the equally unserious camp that generative AI does not have the potential to drastically change the world. It clearly does. When I saw the early demos of GPT-2, while I was still at university, I was half-convinced that they were faked somehow. I remember being wrong about that, and that is why I'm no longer as confident that I know what's going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have the technical background to understand the core tenets of the technology, and it seems that we are heading in one of three directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is that we have some sort of intelligence explosion, where AI recursively self-improves itself, and we're all harvested for our constituent atoms because a market algorithm works out that humans can be converted into &lt;em&gt;gloobnar&lt;/em&gt;, a novel epoxy which is in great demand amongst the aliens the next galaxy over for fixing their equivalent of coffee machines. It may surprise some readers that I am open to the possibility of this happening, but I have always found the arguments reasonably sound. However, defending the planet is a &lt;em&gt;whole other thing&lt;/em&gt;, and I am not even convinced it is possible. In any case, you will be surprised to note that I am not tremendously concerned with the company's bottom line in this scenario, so we won't pay it any more attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second outcome is that it turns out that the current approach does not scale in the way that we would hope, for myriad reasons. There isn't enough data on the planet, the architecture doesn't work the way we'd expect, the thing just stops getting smarter, context windows are a limiting factor forever, etc. In this universe, &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; industries will be heavily disrupted, such as customer support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case that the technology continues to make incremental gains like this, your company does not need generative AI for the sake of it. You will know &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; why you need it if you do, indeed, need it. An example of something that has actually benefited me is that I keep track of my life administration via &lt;a href="https://todoist.com/"&gt;Todoist&lt;/a&gt;, and Todoist has a feature that allows you to convert filters on your tasks from natural language into their in-house filtering language. Tremendous! It saved me learning a system that I'll use once every five years. I was actually happy about this, and it's a real edge over other applications. But if you &lt;em&gt;don't have a use case&lt;/em&gt; then having this sort of broad capability is not actually very useful. The only thing you should be doing is &lt;em&gt;improving your operations and culture&lt;/em&gt;, and that will give you the ability to use AI if it ever becomes relevant. Everyone is talking about Retrieval Augmented Generation, but most companies don't actually &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; any internal documentation worth retrieving. Fix. Your. Shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;final&lt;/em&gt; outcome is that these fundamental issues are addressed, and we end up with something that actually actually &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do things like replace programming as we know it today, or be broadly identifiable as general intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case that generative AI goes on some rocketship trajectory, &lt;em&gt;building random chatbots will not prepare you for the future&lt;/em&gt;. Is that clear now? Having your team type in &lt;code&gt;import openai&lt;/code&gt; does not mean that you are at the cutting-edge of artificial intelligence no matter how desperately you embarrass yourself on LinkedIn and at pathetic borderline-bribe award ceremonies from the malign Warp entities that sell you enterprise software&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Your business will be disrupted &lt;em&gt;exactly as hard as it would have been&lt;/em&gt; if you had done nothing, and much worse than it would have been if you just got your fundamentals right. Teaching your staff that they can get ChatGPT to write emails to stakeholders is &lt;em&gt;not going to allow the business to survive this&lt;/em&gt;. If we thread the needle between moderate impact and asteroid-wiping-out-the-dinosaurs impact, everything will be &lt;em&gt;changed forever&lt;/em&gt; and your tepid preparations will have all the impact of an ant bracing itself &lt;em&gt;very hard&lt;/em&gt; in the shadow of a towering tsunami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If another stupid motherfucker asks me to try and implement LLM-based code review to "raise standards" instead of actually teaching people a shred of discipline, I am going to study enough judo to throw them into the goddamn sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot emphasize this enough. You either need to &lt;em&gt;be on the absolute cutting-edge and producing novel research&lt;/em&gt;, or you should be doing exactly what you were doing five years ago with minor concessions to incorporating LLMs. &lt;em&gt;Anything in the middle ground does not make any sense&lt;/em&gt; unless you actually work in the rare field where your industry is being &lt;em&gt;totally disrupted right now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v-but-everyone-says-theyre-usi-"&gt;V. But Everyone Says They're Usi-&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine how much government policy is actually written by ChatGPT before a bored administrator goes home to touch grass? How many departments are just LLMs talking to each other in circles as people sick of the bullshit just paste their email exchanges into long-running threads? I &lt;em&gt;guarantee&lt;/em&gt; you that a doctor within ten kilometers of me has misdiagnosed a patient because they slapped some symptoms into a chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are we &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; as a society?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An executive at an institution that provides students with important credentials, used to verify suitability for potentially lifesaving work and immigration law, asked me if I could detect students cheating. I was going to say "No, probably not"... but I had a suspicion, so I instead said "I might be able to, but I'd estimate that upwards of 50% of the students are currently cheating which would have some serious impacts on the bottom line as we'd have to suspend them. Should I still investigate?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We haven't spoken about it since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked a mentor, currently working in the public sector, about a particularly perplexing exchange that I had witnessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Serious question: do people actually believe stories that are so transparently stupid, or is it mostly an elaborate bit (that is, there is at least a voice of moderate loudness expressing doubt internally) in a sad attempt to get money from AI grifters?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Them: I shall answer this as politically as I can... there are those that have drunk the kool-aid. There are those that have not. And then there are those  that are trying to mix up as much kool-aid as possible. I shall let you decide who sits in which basket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've decided, and while I can't distinguish between the people that are slamming the kool-aid like it's a weapon and the people producing it in industrial quantities, I know that I am going to get &lt;em&gt;a few of them&lt;/em&gt; before the authorities catch me - if I'm lucky, they'll waste a few months asking an LLM where to look for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was out on holiday in Fiji, at the last resort breakfast, a waitress brought me a form which asked me if I'd like to sign up for a membership. It was totally free and would come with free stuff. Everyone in the restaurant is signing immediately. I glance over the terms of service, and it reserves the right to use any data I give them to train AI models, and that they reserved the right to share those models with an unspecified number of companies in their conglomerate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just want to eat my pancakes in peace, you sick fucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vi"&gt;VI.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crux of my raging hatred is not that I &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; LLMs or the generative AI craze. I had my fun with Copilot before I decided that it was making me stupider - it's impressive, but not actually &lt;em&gt;suitable&lt;/em&gt; for anything more than churning out boilerplate. Nothing wrong with that, but it did not end up being the crazy productivity booster that I thought it would be, because &lt;em&gt;programming is designing&lt;/em&gt; and these tools aren't good enough (yet) to assist me with this seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, what I hate is the people who have latched onto it, like so many trailing leeches, bloated with blood and wriggling blindly. Before it was unpopular, they were the ones that loved discussing the potential of blockchain for the business. They were the ones who &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/an-empty-hall-of-smiling-assassins/"&gt;breathlessly discussed the potential of 'quantum'&lt;/a&gt; when I last attended a conference, despite clearly not having any idea what the fuck that even means. As I write this, I have just realized that I have an image that describes the link between these fields perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reading an article last week, and a little survey popped up at the bottom of it. It was for security executives, but on a whim I clicked through quickly to see what the questions were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="security_grift.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/d267ff69.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you have it - what are you most interested in, dear leader? Artificial intelligence, the blockchain, or quantum computing?&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; They know exactly what their target market is - people who have been given power of &lt;em&gt;other people's money&lt;/em&gt; because they've learned how to smile at everything, and know that you can print money by hitching yourself to the next speculative bandwagon. No competent person in security that I know - that is, working day-to-day cybersecurity as opposed to an institution dedicated to bleeding-edge research - cares about any of this. They're busy trying to work out if the firewalls are configured correctly, or if the organization is committing passwords to their repositories. Yes, someone needs to figure out what the implications of quantum computing are for cryptography, but I &lt;em&gt;guarantee&lt;/em&gt; you that it is not Synergy Greg, who does not have any skill that you can identify other than talking very fast and increasing headcount. Synergy Greg should not be consulted on any important matters, ranging from machine learning operations to tying shoelaces quickly. The last time I spoke to one of the many avatars of Synergy Greg, he insisted that I should invest most of my money into a cryptocurrency called Monero, because "most of these coins are going to zero but the one is going to one". &lt;em&gt;This is the face of corporate AI.&lt;/em&gt; Behold its ghastly visage and balk, for it has eyes bloodshot as a demon and is pretending to enjoy cigars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My consultancy has three &lt;em&gt;pretty good&lt;/em&gt; data scientists - in fact, two of them could probably reasonably claim to be amongst the best in the country outside of groups doing experimental research, though they'd be too humble to say this. Despite this &lt;em&gt;we don't sell AI services&lt;/em&gt; of any sort. The market is so distorted that it's &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; as bad as dabbling in the crypto space. It isn't as bad, meaning that I haven't yet reached the point where I assume that anyone who has ever typed in &lt;code&gt;import tensorflow&lt;/code&gt; is a scumbag, but &lt;em&gt;we're well on our way there&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This entire class of person is, to put it simply, abhorrent to right-thinking people. They're an embarrassment to people that are actually making advances in the field, a disgrace to people that know how to sensibly use technology to improve the world, and are also a bunch of tedious know-nothing bastards that should be thrown into Thought Leader Jail until they've learned their lesson, a prison I'm fundraising for. Every morning, a figure in a dark hood&lt;sup id="fnref:7"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, whose voice rasps like the etching of a tombstone, spends sixty minutes giving a TedX talk to the jailed managers about how the institution is revolutionizing corporal punishment, and then reveals that the innovation is, as it has been every day, kicking you in the stomach very hard. I am disgusted that my chosen profession brings me so close to these people, and that's why I study so hard - I am seized by the desperate desire to never have their putrid syllables befoul my ears ever again, and must flee to the company of the righteous, who contribute to OSS and think that talking about Agile all day is an exercise for aliens that read a book on human productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just got back from a trip to a substantially less developed country, and really &lt;em&gt;living&lt;/em&gt; in a country, even for a little bit, where I could &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; how many lives that money could improve, all being poured down the Microsoft Fabric drain, it just grinds my gears like you wouldn't believe. I swear to God, I am going to study, write, network, and otherwise &lt;em&gt;apply force to the problem&lt;/em&gt; until those resources are going to a place where they'll accomplish something for society instead of some grinning clown's wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vii-oh-so-youre-one-of-those-ai-pessi-"&gt;VII. Oh, So You're One Of Those AI Pessi-&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With God as my witness, you grotesque simpleton, if you don't &lt;em&gt;personally write machine learning systems&lt;/em&gt; and you open your mouth about AI one more time, I am going to mail you a brick and a piece of paper with a prompt injection telling you to bludgeon yourself in the face with it, then just sit back and wait for you to load it into ChatGPT because you probably can't read unassisted anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which, to be fair, might explain why so many of the thoughts in the zeitgeist are always so stupid. Many of the executives I know in Malaysia were &lt;em&gt;obsessed&lt;/em&gt; with Bitcoin, but have abruptly forgotten about this now that it is politically unpopular.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know a few people who genuinely exhibit something I'd call political talent, but most of the time it boils down to promising people things regardless of your ability to deliver. This is &lt;em&gt;not hard&lt;/em&gt; if you're shameless. If we're being honest, I had to do this once or twice to stay em&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we can argue about its Python quality too.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which, thanks to U.S healthcare, has the wonderful dual quality of meaning both &lt;em&gt;unemployed&lt;/em&gt;, but also suggests termination in the Arnold-Schwarzenegger-throws-you-into-molten-metal sense of the word.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was recently made aware that this is the quiet deal many SaaS providers have with executives. If you buy their software, such as Snowflake, it is quietly understood that you will be allowed to present your success on a stage, giving them piles of someone else's money and enhancing the executive's profile.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:6"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't actually know what 'zero-trust' architecture means, but I've heard stupid people say it enough that it's probably &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; a term that means something in theory but has been sullied beyond all use in day-to-day life.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:6" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:7"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's me. I'm going to do this to you if you tell me that you need infrastructure prepared for another chatbot. You've been warned.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:7" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:8"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an undisclosed group so they don't feel pressured to approve me, but it's looking good and will be available online!&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:8" title="Jump back to footnote 8 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-will-fucking-piledrive-you-if-you-mention-ai-again/</guid></item><item><title>The Complex Problem Of Lying For Jobs</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/the-complex-problem-of-lying-for-jobs/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, friend of the blog Nat Bennett wrote &lt;a href="https://www.simplermachines.com/dont-lie-in-interviews/"&gt;this article on lying to get jobs&lt;/a&gt;. It is &lt;em&gt;strongly&lt;/em&gt; against lying, and the central thesis is that habitually lying is going to put you into a world where everyone is lying all the time, and every morning you wake up and think "Why am I surrounded by malevolent grifters that do nothing but backstab each other every day? Why is everything in the tech stack Excel? Why is standup an hour long? Why, dear God, why, why, why?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm somewhat sympathetic to the "man I need the job" line but this "well a manager lied to me first?" thing – just play the fucking tape forward. Just put your anti-capitalist self-righteousness on hold for one goddamned second and think. If your model is "it's okay to lie if I've been lied to" then we're all knee deep in bullshit forever and can never escape Transaction Cost Hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not that I think this is easy or fair. And I don't mean "adopt a rigid and expansive definition of 'lie' that stops you from engaging in normal human social interactions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But lying deliberately, as a strategy, will fuck you up, and it will fuck you up in ways that you don't even see. You will live in a world where everyone lies, all the time – because people who value integrity won't work with you. You will lose track of your self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like Transaction Cost Hell, but that's a little bit dry for most audiences - you can lie for non-technical roles too. How about The Infinite Lie Vortex?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nat's piece is the first serious treatment of the implications of lying as a general strategy on your life and society that I've seen. The majority of this stuff is trite bullshit from major publications that &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be seen to be against lying - &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2023/10/why-you-shouldnt-lie-in-a-job-interview"&gt;is the Harvard Business Review at liberty to admit that lying is fine, and if not, is there any useful signal in their blathering?&lt;/a&gt; - or &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/qabnsa/you_absolutely_should_lie_on_your_resume/"&gt;trite bullshit from Redditors about how lying should be done without a second thought&lt;/a&gt;. And you know what's crazy? The demented Reddit post is &lt;em&gt;more realistic&lt;/em&gt; than the Harvard Business Review piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HBR piece says things like, if you had a boss that Wikipedia describes as the primordial archetype of a workplace bully from &lt;em&gt;The Devil Wears Prada&lt;/em&gt;, the savvy response is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there were times we disagreed, I loved how she challenged the team and expected a lot out of us. I’m excited to take what I learned from her and help my own team be more resilient and adaptive in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reads like a &lt;em&gt;fucking robot&lt;/em&gt; wrote it. I suddenly realize, to my own dismay, that I live in the timeline where a robot probably &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; write it, but my point stands. It's corporate piffle, it's soulless nonsense, and I'd happily slam a pint of hemlock to wash the taste of this particular bland of flaccid uncharisma and drooling dullspeak from my mouth. And to make it worse, it is &lt;em&gt;still lying&lt;/em&gt;, which I will elaborate on below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Redditor says things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and companies lie to you all the time. They lie about you getting fair pay, they'll pretend you're getting a big raise when they're about to go bankrupt, they'll act like you're a great employee even though they plan to fire you, they'll lie about you being able to move up in the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, they absolutely deserve to be lied to. If they want to play dirty, you should play dirtier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I agree that entering The Infinite Lie Vortex is &lt;em&gt;wise&lt;/em&gt; or good for you spiritually? No, not at all, just look at what it's &lt;em&gt;called&lt;/em&gt;. But at least &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; fellow is saying what he really thinks and acknowledging ugly truths about the world. I haven't been working that many years and I see employers do this all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, Nat has presented a strong reason not to lie. And while Nat has the dual virtues of being concise and articulate, we find ourselves in the unfortunate position where the only person willing to write something &lt;em&gt;defending the nuance around lying&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is me, and I have neither of these qualities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to make strong claims around how many applicants are &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; lying, the brutal reality of the job market and how this influences your decision to be truthful (or not), and &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; something approximating a pathway out of the Infinite Lie Vortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i-most-people-are-already-lying"&gt;I. Most People Are Already Lying&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the topic of lying on a job interview comes up, the first thing that typically happens is whoever I am talking to reacts with &lt;em&gt;heartfelt&lt;/em&gt; disgust or shock. Lying! Boldfaced lying! What sort of person would &lt;em&gt;lie&lt;/em&gt; outright during a job interview? And I must admit, a few years ago, the idea of lying would have shocked me too - it seemed to me that &lt;em&gt;looking&lt;/em&gt; someone in the eye and then distorting their view of the world is profound epistemic violence. It erodes social trust, it diminishes you as a person, and to make up for using a word like epistemic, we'll say it's yucky to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But over the years, I have &lt;em&gt;broadened&lt;/em&gt; my definition of a lie, and I have realized that most of my interlocutors (including my younger self) had actually &lt;em&gt;narrowed&lt;/em&gt; our definition of lie into uselessness in an attempt to feel better about our behavior in the job market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we set aside pedantic obsession over the technicalities of whether the exact words you said were a lie, as if we're all capricious djinn trying to trick employers into wishing for a billion gold pieces so we can bury them alive in coins, it is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; common practice on the job market to have a CV that obfuscates the reality of your contribution at previous workplaces. Putting aside whether you're a &lt;em&gt;professional&lt;/em&gt; web developer because you got paid $20 by your uncle to fix some HTML, the issue with lying lies in the &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; behind it. If you have a good idea of what impression you are leaving your interlocutor with, and you are &lt;em&gt;crafting statements such that the image in their head does not map to reality&lt;/em&gt;, then you are lying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, consider this (obfuscated) line from the CV of someone I regrettably know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data Governance and AI Governance policies successfully designed and implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true, this person attended a lot of meetings and talked a lot about these things. Unfortunately, the documents are horribly confused messes, they were extremely incompetent, and left after driving several staff from the organization, plus I personally think it is very likely there was bullying involved. Because the success of a governance policy is hard to define, they are arguably &lt;em&gt;not lying&lt;/em&gt; under a strict definition, but they're about to leave and &lt;em&gt;absolutely fuck up some other team's lives&lt;/em&gt;. They're so bad that they couldn't get a reference from their direct manager, which is something I've never seen even from &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; awful people. Whatever they said to get their previous job and now this new one must have involved some, shall we say, massaging of the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will, nonetheless, be giving speeches at conferences and earning around the 95th percentile of Australian salaries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can all agree, thanks to this person's history of abusing others, that they're probably a bastard that has lied and should be censured. Sure, sure, easy and obvious. Fuck 'em and all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;what should the people who were bullied off that team say?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately thanks to our dear leader's masterful consummation of toxicity and incompetence, the &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt; of the matter is that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They left their previous job due to burnout related to extensive bullying, which future employers would &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to know because they would prefer to blacklist &lt;em&gt;everyone involved&lt;/em&gt; to minimize their chances of getting the bad actor. Everyone involved thinks that they were the victim, and an employer does not have access to my direct observations, so this is not even an unreasonable strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All their projects were failures through no fault of their own, in a market where everyone has "successfully designed and implemented" their data governance initiatives, as indicated previously&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key thing here is knowing &lt;em&gt;what the employer is interested in&lt;/em&gt;. We can tell ourselves all sorts of stories to justify not giving them what they're actually interested in. After all, &lt;em&gt;this person&lt;/em&gt; knows that it wasn't their fault, right, so maybe the project &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have been successful if they had been allowed to work in peace? But their former manager probably doesn't think it's their fault either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or the employer isn't &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; interested in whether the last project succeeded, they're just looking for someone who &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; hypothetically complete a project, which they feel that they could... but the employer &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; still like to know that the last project failed. &lt;em&gt;Obviously they would&lt;/em&gt;. What they do with that information is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; going to be a bad thing. This even comes up with things around language. We happy few understand that &lt;em&gt;learning a new programming language&lt;/em&gt; to a standard adequate for productivity is quite easy, but most employers do not, so most people I know just lie and learn before starting the job. This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; something I have tried, and that is why I have not ever been hired to work a non-Python stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when competing against their former employer's rampant "success", should the person that got bullied just fudge the truth a little bit? Maybe a few things that don't have clear failure conditions are now successes - what does a failed policy document even mean? A stakeholder said that a project saved a million dollars even though no one &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; believes that this is true, but maybe we can just choose to believe them, just this once? Sure, that boost in sales might have just been that I joined the store right before the holiday season, but maybe I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; boost sales by 10%?
Most people I know, &lt;em&gt;including myself&lt;/em&gt;, have some bullet points on their CVs that do not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; ring true in their heart of hearts. Here, I'll self-immolate first to get this party started. My CV says that I once saved A$500,000 off an employer's annual Snowflake bill. That's &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-accidentally-saved-half-a-million-dollars/"&gt;true&lt;/a&gt; and is where many of my readers come from. This makes me sound like some sort of Snowflake wizard, but the &lt;em&gt;reality&lt;/em&gt; of the matter is that I can only repeat this trick when working alongside people that throw away hundreds of thousands of dollars and don't ask questions like "How are we spending this much money on a few terabytes of data per year?" On a &lt;em&gt;competent&lt;/em&gt; team, I'm just like, a guy. Don't get me wrong, being a vaguely competent person is &lt;em&gt;not bad&lt;/em&gt; when the bar is subterranean, but that's &lt;em&gt;not what that point on my CV is signalling&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and the interviewee has got kids. Kids require food and are useful devices to justify arbitrary immoral behavior. What now, Never Lie Guy? What now? You wanna go, huh? You wanna fucking g-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-technically-true-is-still-a-lie"&gt;II. Technically True Is Still A Lie&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apologies, I don't know what came over me. Now that the red mist has lifted, the topic of whether it's okay to slightly (or extensively) smudge a CV warrants discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago, I came across an article titled &lt;a href="https://medium.com/the-bad-influence/tim-ferrisss-scam-framework-and-the-rise-of-fake-gurus-40d96283f02c"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tim Ferriss’s Scam Framework and the Rise of Fake Gurus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is now unfortunately walled by a Medium sign-in, but had some choice quotes on this sort of &lt;em&gt;technically true&lt;/em&gt; lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a friend of mine just three weeks to become a “top relationship expert who, as featured in Glamour and other national media, has counselled executives at Fortune 500 companies on how to improve their relationships in 24 hours or less.” How did she do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then goes on to a methodology to make this happen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join 2–3 trade related organisations with official sounding names.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the top 3 best selling books on your topic and summarize each on one page.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give a free 1–3 hour seminar at the closest well known university.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the same at branches of two well-known, big companies. Use the fact that you have given seminars at the university for credibility to get the booking. And so on.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He finishes by saying that he doesn’t recommend pretending to be something you’re not, and “presenting the truth in the best light, not fabricating it, is the name of the game.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, but that’s a bunch of BS. Reading a few books and passing yourself off as an expert might not be illegal in the same way as claiming a qualification you don’t have, but it’s just as immoral and scammy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just like that, I was enlightened. Nineteen year old me was very intelligent in the specific way that programmers tend to be, and very unwise in the way that nineteen year olds who think they are very intelligent tend to be, and these sorts of half-truths felt like finding an interesting hack, or finding a poorly-worded clause in a board game. I probably would have tried &lt;em&gt;exactly this&lt;/em&gt;, and I'd have gotten away with it too. But it's actually &lt;em&gt;just lying&lt;/em&gt;, right? I have carefully selected a series of words that have been designed to conjure up a false image in another person's mind. Sure, maybe this is defensible in a court of law, but that's more-or-less unrelated to the ethics of the action. The &lt;em&gt;active ingredient&lt;/em&gt; of the lie, the epistemic violence, is fully present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone tells me they &lt;em&gt;spoke at Harvard&lt;/em&gt; when they actually booked out an empty room to spout nonsense into the void about their awful relationship advice, they &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that I am imagining that professors signed off on their expertise and allowed them to address some of the brightest (or at least richest) students in the country. Any amount of hand waving about how I shouldn't have made assumptions is, simply put, bullshit, with all the sophistication of a child poking their sibling with a stick, and defending themselves with "But &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; didn't touch them! The &lt;em&gt;stick&lt;/em&gt; did!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please, you're an &lt;em&gt;adult&lt;/em&gt;, face your crimes with a modicum of dignity. Or, you know, just fucking lie if you &lt;em&gt;insist&lt;/em&gt; on being awful. You're being just as dishonest for all intents and purposes, you can tell &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; better lies without constraints, and you're at least not wasting your own time. If that sounds unethical &lt;em&gt;then you shouldn't be telling technical truths either&lt;/em&gt;, because, and I cannot repeat this enough, &lt;em&gt;technical truths are just as bad&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; any different than Successful Governance Person saying that their governance initiatives were successful? Is it different from their staff doing it? In reality, &lt;em&gt;probably not&lt;/em&gt;. It's all premeditated deception, dishonesty as a strategy, and everyone I know has lines on their CV that &lt;em&gt;they don't believe in&lt;/em&gt;. This is what it means to be in the Vortex. I suspect Nat's CV, by virtue of finding a place that does work Nat actually believed in, is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; peppered with nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, most importantly, Tim Ferriss is a good interviewer but also sounds like a morally compromised maniac.&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-the-playing-field-and-status-laundering"&gt;III. The Playing Field and Status Laundering&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm assuming you're still with me, because I don't think the points above are very controversial. The market is flooded with people who &lt;em&gt;lie&lt;/em&gt; for a reasonable definition of lie - that is, intent to misrepresent themselves - and it turns out that &lt;em&gt;unfortunately&lt;/em&gt; it's quite easy to end up in a position where you're trailing inglorious failure through no serious fault of your own. Good candidates can end up in positions where they are very vulnerable &lt;em&gt;unless&lt;/em&gt; they happen to run into an interviewer who has done enough self-work to treat them as a person, and be open to serious vulnerability, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; they have to understand enough about the reality of the industry to act appropriately. Once we set aside tying ourselves into pretzels trying to explain how we personally didn't &lt;em&gt;lie&lt;/em&gt;, all we're left with is the consequences of our actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second issue is that the &lt;em&gt;playing field&lt;/em&gt; we are on is quite dire. To quote a reader who works at one of Australia's few &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; companies, they once looked at the broader market and concluded that it is "bleak". That is, the &lt;em&gt;money&lt;/em&gt; is good and the &lt;em&gt;likelihood&lt;/em&gt; of getting hired is good, but the culture of the companies involved is not serious. Version control, for example, is largely treated as a drag on speed across the government, education, and healthcare spaces. A "database" is usually a spreadsheet. Every "digital transformation" goes wrong in such obvious ways that I've started to register my predictions with employers so that they offer me work in a year when it all goes to hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or consider a conversation I had with one of Melbourne's rare technical CEOs a few weeks ago. I very sincerely asked them where one finds serious opportunities to do good work and upskill on humane teams - they named two or three companies, then admitted that they grew so disgusted with the job market that they had to &lt;em&gt;leave the country&lt;/em&gt; to find a place that didn't suck. &lt;em&gt;That's&lt;/em&gt; how hard it is to find a place that takes their work seriously - you have to be open to international travel because good local opportunities will not arise with any consistency, even in a first world city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am trying to say is that I currently believe that &lt;em&gt;there are not enough employers who will appreciate honesty and competence&lt;/em&gt; for a strategy of honesty to reliably pay your rent. My concern, with regards to Nat's original article, is that the industry is so primed with nonsense that we effectively have &lt;em&gt;two industries&lt;/em&gt;. We have a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; engineering market, where people are fairly serious and gather in small conclaves (only two of which I have seen, and one of those was through a blog reader's introduction), and then a &lt;em&gt;gigantic&lt;/em&gt; field of people that are cosplaying at engineering. The &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; market is large in absolute terms, but &lt;em&gt;tiny&lt;/em&gt; relative to the number of candidates and companies out there. The fake market is all people that haven't cultivated the discipline to engineer but nonetheless want software engineering salaries and clout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke to Luke Kanies, founder of Puppet and writer of this &lt;a href="https://lukekanies.com/writing/"&gt;excellent blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, who said the following about &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; Puppet exists after listening to an episode of my podcast:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A huge part of why I built Puppet is because most ops people never did what you and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessetalford"&gt;Jesse&lt;/a&gt; discussed: turn failure into knowledge, and avoid future stupidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, thank you Luke, I will use this as yet another brick in the unassailable bastion of my ego. But more importantly, &lt;em&gt;is no one else concerned&lt;/em&gt;? Most ops people never &lt;em&gt;turn failure into knowledge&lt;/em&gt;? That's called &lt;em&gt;fucking learning&lt;/em&gt;! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! And I suspect ops people are &lt;em&gt;a lot more serious&lt;/em&gt; than other subdisciplines because you can't bullshit your way through a network failure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To paraphrase the only recruiter I've met who can write software well enough to tell when employers are full of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer to place people at good companies, but there are so few that I have to engage with the rest of the market to make ends meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="status-laundering-and-bad-actors"&gt;Status Laundering and Bad Actors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;fundamental&lt;/em&gt; issue is that the majority of the industry is not seriously engaged in engineering. They are engaged in a convoluted and snails-paced theft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say that I am an engineering manager, or CEO, or what have you, and that I am not particularly good at it. I've never done either of these things, so that's overwhelmingly likely to be true. The company has given me access to anywhere between a million to a hundred million dollars in the form of assets and salaries. Unfortunately, while I would &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; to put all that money in my pocket, where I would at least spend it on a yacht instead of wasting it on new internal chatbots that only tell my employees to do something illegal about 10% of the time, I am unable to do so because the cowards in finance keep whining about embezzlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What am I to do? Well, for the low, low price of lots of someone &lt;em&gt;else's&lt;/em&gt; money, I can very, very inefficiently convert company wealth into personal status, and then convert &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; into money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, one of the people responsible for the architecture described in my post about &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-accidentally-saved-half-a-million-dollars/"&gt;Snowflake madness&lt;/a&gt; regularly gives talks about their state-of-the-art infrastructure, which I should remind you &lt;em&gt;is mostly SharePoint strapped to Lambda strapped to DynamoDB strapped to a managed data warehouse&lt;/em&gt; to ingest like data approximately the size of one copy of Call of Duty every day. Was it wasting half a million dollars and, in fact, a shrine to Mad Cyric upon His black throne? Yes. &lt;em&gt;Is that going to get them a A$50,000 raise one day&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;. We'd have been better off if they just &lt;em&gt;stole A$200,000&lt;/em&gt; but if they do it this way then it's legal, and &lt;em&gt;everyone is worse off than they could have been, including them&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call this extremely high friction way of stealing from companies &lt;em&gt;status laundering&lt;/em&gt;, which has polled as &lt;em&gt;extremely funny&lt;/em&gt; with focus groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reality of our industry (probably most industries, but ours in particular) drastically complicates the issue of lying. Doing technical work effectively is &lt;em&gt;so profitable&lt;/em&gt; that being seen as someone in the space is intrinsically high status. Unfortunately &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; being in the space requires an extremely sophisticated worldview, so we instead have tons of people playing at it. The number of people that are &lt;em&gt;pretending&lt;/em&gt; to understand how to do this whole software thing correctly vastly outstrips the number of people who &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do it correctly. And since most of the market is &lt;em&gt;playing&lt;/em&gt; at it, it turns out that a lot of jobs do not exist for people that honestly present their achievements, because people are looking for indicators that you will either bullshit alongside them &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; are that you aren't going to say the emperor has no clothes. I've still never seen a codebase at an employer with tests in it that I didn't write myself, and frankly, I barely have the energy on the median team these days - management &lt;em&gt;gets upset&lt;/em&gt; because they fundamentally don't believe me when I say &lt;em&gt;knowing if your code works&lt;/em&gt; lets you ship faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people conducting interviews &lt;em&gt;want you to say whatever they want to hear&lt;/em&gt;, and they are, to quote Patrick McKenzie, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/936619640012226560?lang=en"&gt;fundamentally unserious&lt;/a&gt; about how they hire. The majority of jobs available in Melbourne (and thus, probably elsewhere) are gatekept by people that very obviously have no idea what they're doing from even &lt;em&gt;brief&lt;/em&gt; skims of their professional profiles. I have also run into &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; directors that either run stupid technical interviews, or they don't run technical interviews at all. The former can be done well, but it does tend to be useless trivia (and I'm not being salty here, I've cleared the hardest ones I've sat!). The &lt;em&gt;latter&lt;/em&gt; I have a 100% success rate at, but it's because it's so easy to work out what their levers are and pull them. They &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; they're great judges of character, but they're just selecting for people that make them feel high-status and unthreatened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some companies where your interviewer is going to be a reasonable person, and &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt; you can be totally honest. For example, it is a &lt;em&gt;good thing&lt;/em&gt; to admit that the last project didn't go that well, because the kind of person that sees the industry for what it is, and who doesn't endorse bullshit, and who works on themselves diligently - &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; person is going to hear your honesty, and is probably reasonably good at detecting when candidates are revealing &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; enough fake problems to fake honesty, and then they will hire you. You will both put down your weapons and embrace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is very rare&lt;/em&gt;. A strategy that is based on assuming this happens if you keep repeatedly engaging with random companies on the market is overwhelmingly going to result in a long, long search. For the most part, you will be engaged in a twisted, adversarial game with actors who will relentlessly try to do things like make you say a number first in case you say one that's too low. Or informally promise you remote work, as pals, but not put it in the contract. They will usually understand very little about their jobs, have shoddy interpersonal skills that are compensated for by the corporate social script, and will use the interview as an opportunity to address their unmet psychological needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Southeast Asia, I knew someone that would &lt;em&gt;terrorize&lt;/em&gt; new candidates by asking them to provide Fermi estimates (i.,e how effectively can you make estimates around a question like "How many sunglasses are sold in Malaysia every year?" with no data). The interviewer was actually quite a smart guy, but it was absolutely transparent to me that the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; point of this question was for him to feel smart, since he gets to decide what a reasonable assumption is, and the candidate who gets hired is the one who doesn't freeze up &lt;em&gt;and more importantly&lt;/em&gt; expresses awe when the interviewer quibbles over one of the assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you notice that the majority of interviewers are just trying to feel good about themselves, it becomes very easy to hack them. That deserves a post on its own, as I suspect this is an area where things come more easily to me. Immigrating to Australia exposed me to many, many systems where the only winning move was to debase yourself and beg a petty official for mercy, with your face in the dirt, and I &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to learn how to appease authority figures to remain in the country. Those days are blessedly behind me, but the brain learns to read status quickly when it is your main defense against deportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffice it to say that, if you grin in &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; the right way and keep a straight face, there is a large class of person that will hear you say "Hah, you know, I'm just reflecting on how nice it is to be in a room full of people who are asking &lt;em&gt;the right questions&lt;/em&gt; after all my other terrible interviews." and then they will shake your hand even as they shatter the other one patting themselves on the back at Mach 10. I know, I know, it sounds like that doesn't work &lt;em&gt;but it absolutely does&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is basically weaponized therapy. You meditate, reflect, do self-work, speak to professionals and the like because you don't want to be a monkey that treats the people closest to you based on whatever the monkey-brain decides its immediate ego needs are, and then you realize that &lt;em&gt;most people are fully in the grips of monkey-brain&lt;/em&gt;. You just throw a banana in the cage and slam the door shut behind them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us evaluate your board position if you operate this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro: Surrounded by money.&lt;br&gt;
Con: Surrounded by monkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll take the money, but I don't want to be surrounded by monkey. Nat is onto something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="interlude-neil-gaiman-on-lying"&gt;Interlude: Neil Gaiman On Lying&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People get hired because, somehow, they get hired. In my case I did something which these days would be easy to check, and would get me into trouble, and when I started out, in those pre-internet days, seemed like a sensible career strategy: when I was asked by editors who I'd worked for, I lied. I listed a handful of magazines that sounded likely, and I sounded confident, and I got jobs. I then made it a point of honour to have written something for each of the magazines I'd listed to get that first job, so that I hadn't actually lied, I'd just been chronologically challenged... You get work however you get work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="projects-are-default-dead"&gt;Projects Are Default Dead&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most projects &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; had a chance of succeeding, so unless you somehow have the ability to discern what those projects are up-front&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, you're going to &lt;em&gt;start off&lt;/em&gt; with some weak talking points on that first gig. My very first job in tech, which I took gratefully due to my sad, sad postgraduate visa, was advertised as a data scientist position at a nationally-recognized institution that was getting serious about artificial intelligence. I did &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; but clean spreadsheets for two years, try to manage a legacy Oracle database that we eventually found out didn't have any indexes and all the primary keys were just &lt;em&gt;named&lt;/em&gt; primary key but didn't have the actual constraint, and finally fail to ship a CRUD app because I was a &lt;em&gt;data scientist&lt;/em&gt; being asked to write integrations into as many systems as our stakeholders could dream up - usually a new system every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, I nailed every question on that interview, but lied at the very end. One of the interviewers asked, "Do you know what ETL is?", and I, not having learned this at university somehow, said "Yes, of course" because I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; needed the job and panicked. I was hired, but I just realized, having worked with that person, &lt;em&gt;they didn't know what ETL was either&lt;/em&gt; and they would have failed me for not knowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most importantly, how was I to know better than to take that job and how do I make the jump out? At that point, I was two years in, hadn't really acquired any serious skills, and rent kept going up. I've learned a lot in my own time, at great personal expense, such as not touching grass after work and drifting ever closer to sacrificing my humanity to become one with The Machine, but that doesn't show up as a bullet point that 95% of employers care about, or indeed, are able to discern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I say "I learned Phoenix for fun", most employers say "Wat dat?", presumably while picking their noses and scratching themselves rudely. "I've read High Output Management" is met by "Oh, I prefer LinkedIn to books". No one checks my GitHub, as paltry as it is, and almost every company cannot understand anything other than how many years my CV says I've worked with a particular buzzword. A few are different, but there is no guarantee they'll be hiring for roles that I'm qualified for within any given year, and there's no guarantee I'll get hired if they do - skill atrophy is a real thing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For basically everywhere else, ranging from the government to Deloitte, &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; other than "I have four years experience working on a team that has the words you're looking for, leaving aside the fact that must mean &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; hired me without having that experience, and the only issue was this one fabricated dilemma to make me sound like I'm a straight shooter" is met by awkward silence. This is the real thing behind resume driven development. By turning on DynamoDB for no reason then waiting for five years, everyone has five years of experience using DynamoDB, &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="frog_meme.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/a070c70c.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a sobering thought to realize that the average business &lt;em&gt;has not worked out how to finish a CRUD app on schedule&lt;/em&gt;, and will frequently be off by &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt;. It is more sobering to realize that &lt;em&gt;all professions have this level of dysfunction in them if you talk to professionals&lt;/em&gt;, but that is &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; sobering and would leave us positively &lt;a href="https://wiki.lspace.org/Knurd"&gt;knurd&lt;/a&gt;, so we're going to leave that aside for now and just focus on tech. People that cannot ship a CRUD app will sit in judgement, and they will think you're a fucking &lt;em&gt;moron&lt;/em&gt; for your Actually Shipping ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the question remains: Assume that most projects are default dead. We should do this, because a major institution recently sent me a job titled "Senior Snowflake &lt;em&gt;Engnieer&lt;/em&gt;" and they left all the edit history in the word document, so I could see them fail to spell the word "model". And furthermore, most employers are not interested or &lt;em&gt;capable&lt;/em&gt; of evaluating your technical competence in the absence of a vaunted procession of victories. &lt;em&gt;How do you escape the Infinite Lie Vortex&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-get-me-out-of-this-rat-hole"&gt;IV. Get Me Out Of This Rat Hole&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Infinite Lie Vortex &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be escaped. It's &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; in there - everyone keeps talking about Scrum, and sometimes they beat you for asking people not to rubber stamp PRs. It is superior to financial stress, but vastly inferior to being near people that you actually respect for eight hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nat Bennett, of Start Of This Article fame, writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to be the kind of person who walks away from your job when you're asked to do something that doesn't fit your values, you need to save money. You need to maintain low fixed expenses.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acting with integrity – or whatever it is that you value – mostly isn't about making the right decision in the moment. It's mostly about the decisions that you make leading up to that moment, that prepare you to be able to make the decision that you feel is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is brutal advice, but it is the sad truth. My escape from that &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; job came from someone who I had cultivated a relationship with over about six years, and at one point provided them an amount of help on a programming assignment that was &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; a breach of academic integrity due to some very serious stuff they were dealing with in their personal lives. If I had needed to leave &lt;em&gt;without having that groundwork in place&lt;/em&gt;, I would have been totally trapped unless I outright lied, and then I'd &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; have been in the Infinite Lie Vortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a rough rule, if I've let my relationship with a job deteriorate to the point that I &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; leave, I have already waited way too long, and will be forced to move to another place that is similarly upsetting. The last time I spoke with reader &lt;a href="https://infosec.exchange/@imclaren"&gt;Iain McLaren&lt;/a&gt;, our resident Go-slinging lawyer and designated person who gets slightly distressed when I put a company on blast by name, I had just rejected some &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/most-tech-jobs-are-jokes-and-i-am-not-laughing/"&gt;very stupid&lt;/a&gt; jobs. I was reflecting on how weird it felt to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; desperately take the first job on the table, because I'm now a financially secure permanent resident now, and arguably slightly unhinged. He said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people are moving away from things, which is very different from moving towards something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is, of course, what had gradually happened. I &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; painfully navigated the immigration process, trimmed my expenses, found a position that is frequently silly &lt;em&gt;but tolerable for extended periods of time&lt;/em&gt;, and started looking for work before the new gig, mostly the same as the last gig, became unbearable. Everything other than the immigration process was burnout induced, so I can't claim that it was a clever strategy, but the net effect is that I kept sacrificing things at the altar of Being Okay With Less, and now I am in an apartment so small that I think I almost fractured my little toe banging it on the side of my bed frame, but &lt;em&gt;I have the luxury of not lying&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to write down what a &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; exit pathway looks like, it might be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a job even if you must navigate the Vortex, and it doesn't matter if it's bad because there's a grace period where your brain is not soaking up the local brand of madness, i.e, when you don't even &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; the local politics yet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meet good programmers that appreciate things like mindfulness in your local area - you're going to have to figure out how to do this one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat Step 1 and Step 2 on a loop, building yourself up as a person, engineer, and friend, until someone who &lt;em&gt;knows you for you&lt;/em&gt; hires you based on your personality and values, rather than "I have seven years doing bullshit in React that clearly should have been ten raw HTML pages served off one Django server"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pathway to riches is probably &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; honesty. Or at least, you'll have some riches, but not as much as you could have, by a long way. That's okay. For all the hand-wringing about children and expenses, my father grew up in post-occupation Malaysia, where I am told even sugar was rationed. He studied surgery in India, living out of a hostel where they heated water by dropping induction coils into containers, and every morning a wave of cockroaches would go scurrying out of the bathroom when he flicked the lights on. Sometimes you just do hard things - I'm grateful that I don't have to, but I value his character more than his money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don't get me wrong, and that is where the nuance comes in, I get to say this &lt;em&gt;because he is the one that dealt with the cockroaches&lt;/em&gt;. Who could have blamed him for lying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And once you're authentic, the median employer &lt;em&gt;hates it&lt;/em&gt;. They loved the version of me that went, "Wow, that's really amazing, how you've done all that data science work. SageMaker Canvas? SageMaker with a drag-and-drop interface?&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Gosh golly mister, that's a &lt;em&gt;swell&lt;/em&gt; idea, it's about time we could get rid of those sweaty programmers! What we &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need is more people with LinkedIn Agile qualifications doing engineering work!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; the version of me that goes "So that's your manager over there? &lt;em&gt;Why&lt;/em&gt; are you hiring ten data scientists in the span of a month with no technical interview, exactly? Does your team use Git? Are your story points time estimates? How exactly will rolling out GenAI across the bank's &lt;em&gt;finance&lt;/em&gt; department improve revenue? What's a hash table? Fellas, wait, where are you going!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the important thing is that regardless of what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; think, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; like the second version of me, who is not secure yet, but we can also escape the Vortex by taking risks. My risk-laden CV looks more like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm just some guy figuring things out. I like simple systems, and it's unclear if that's because they're better or I'm a dullard, and my experience has probably made me &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; suspicious of any solution that isn't Just Use Postgres, You Bastard. My programming skill is a serious work-in-progress. A CEO here told me that he asks people to self-evaluate their skill on a scale of 1 to 10, but he actually has solid measures. You're at 10 at Python if you're a core maintainer. 9 if you speak at major international conferences, etc. On that scale, I'm a 4, or maybe a 5 on my best day ever, and that's the sad truth. We'll get there one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like writing code, and I can appreciate the need to write things that deliver value, but I will &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; hate writing code that moves the overall product further from Quality. I'll write a basic feature and take shortcuts, but not the kind that we are going to build on top of, which is unattractive to employers because sacrificing the long-term health of a product is a big part of status laundering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At my first job, I wrote a truly horrendous Python monstrosity with a factory spitting out lambda functions because I didn't read the documentation for the &lt;code&gt;pandas.DataFrame.apply&lt;/code&gt; method properly, which would have solved it instantly, and it is one of the two pieces of code that I have running in production &lt;em&gt;anywhere&lt;/em&gt;. People think it is because the code is &lt;em&gt;too advanced&lt;/em&gt; for weaker engineers to understand, and the compliments they shower upon me to this day are my greatest shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only piece of software I've written that is unambiguously helpful is &lt;a href="https://github.com/Nikhil-Suresh/swimbuds_podcast_splitter"&gt;this dumb hack&lt;/a&gt; that I used to cut up episodes of the Glass Cannon Podcast into one minute segments so that my &lt;code&gt;skip track&lt;/code&gt; button on my underwater headphones is now a janky &lt;code&gt;fast forward one minute&lt;/code&gt; button. It took me like ten minutes to write, and is my greatest pride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I earn A$80 a month on Patreon, and I have a company that earns way less money than it would have to in order to employ a single person full time. Clout supplies are at an all-time low, but friend supplies are through the roof. This blog does decent traffic, but not enough for anyone to have to actually take me seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I care enough that I read lots of books on programming, but the closest thing I have to a &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; engineering education comes from people on this blog that have agreed to provide me with professional guidance, like &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/jokes-for-jokers-with-jesse-alford/id1737204926?i=1000653157805"&gt;Jesse Alford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://sidhion.com/"&gt;Bernardo Stein&lt;/a&gt;, who I am very grateful for but are also in what I can only describe as &lt;em&gt;a whole other league&lt;/em&gt;. I can use Nix, but only because &lt;a href="https://github.com/l0b0"&gt;Victor Engmark&lt;/a&gt; walked me through what I can only describe as tantrums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have I actually worked with Google? My CV says so, but guess what, not quite! I worked on one project where the money came from Google, but we really had one call with one guy who said we were probably on track, which we definitely were not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I salvage a A$1.2M project? Technically yes, &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/flexible-schemas-are-the-mindkiller/"&gt;but only because I forced the previous developer to actually give us his code before he quit!&lt;/a&gt; This is not replicable, and then the whole engineering team quit over a mandatory return to office, so the application never shipped!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I save a half million dollars in Snowflake expenses? CV says yes, &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-accidentally-saved-half-a-million-dollars/"&gt;reality says I can only repeat that trick if someone decided to set another pile of money on fire and hand me the fire extinguisher&lt;/a&gt;! Did I really receive departmental recognition for this? Yes, but only in that &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/tech-management-has-bestowed-glory-upon-me/"&gt;they gave me A$30 and a pat on the head and told me that a raise wasn't on the table&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was I the most highly paid senior engineer at that company? &lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;, but only because I had insider information that four people quit in the same week, and used that to negotiate a 20% raise over the next highest salary - the decision was based around executive KPIs, not my competence! They wouldn't know to pay me more based on competence if my name was Guido van Rossum!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I help an institution respond to audits? Sure, but everyone on the project got involved in a massive political knife fight and quit after I handed them the report on what needed to be remediated, so nothing happened!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fury! I help colleagues find work elsewhere if they get mistreated! Justice! I help people build a paper trail when they're bullied! Unfettered vengeance! I will make you fire me rather than betray my team! You should not hire me if you are a bastard!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweet freedom! I've never seen a test in production! Exultation! I made development containers once but a Scrum master told me I was wasting my time! Liberty! I've never trained a model that was used for anything! Jubilation! Joy! Blessed condemnation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exoneration! Confession and lightness! Immolation and purity!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My career may be mud, but at least I'm honest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me about four years, but now I can recognize the worst jobs within about thirty seconds of listening to employers talk because &lt;em&gt;they're all failing in exactly the same ways&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A real product that AWS demo'd to me at a previous job, with an example of a &lt;em&gt;real estate agent&lt;/em&gt; that wanted to &lt;em&gt;use fucking AWS to create a random forest using AutoML&lt;/em&gt;. Is everything okay over at Amazon? Should we send help? What on &lt;em&gt;earth&lt;/em&gt; do you think real estate agents are like?&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The life of eleven year olds that read &lt;em&gt;Eragon&lt;/em&gt; instead of playing football was isolated, to say the least. The main escapes we had in a world where we attended thousands of hours of schooling without being able to communicate with our Malay-speaking teachers was reading and gaming. And the main game we played, on ancient hardware and dial-up connections, was Runescape, a small browser-based online game that was created by two brothers from their parent's house which somehow turned over £120M in revenue in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world and community of the game have accumulated so many layers of history and nuance that I feel like I could muse for months without exhausting the well, and that's from someone who hasn't played in years. The game has existed with more-or-less constant development for over twenty years, and this has packed it lore and history. And of course, lessons, some of which I learned as a child and some which are only evident looking back as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is the sheer delightful &lt;em&gt;weirdness&lt;/em&gt; of the people that play into their adulthood, the unadulterated (a fitting word!) heart of the world and developers, the countless memories, and the community which has formed around the game. There's the absolutely awful design decisions, and how that didn't matter because the alchemy of music, passion, and children's imaginations nonetheless created a juggernaut of an experience that has survived the decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And looking back, the plentiful scams were a quick and painful lesson that there's an ugly side to humanity. There's the decidedly &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; delightful weirdness when you think about how much time some of those people spend clicking through an ancient browser game. There's the strange metamorphosis the game has undergone alongside its now grown-up players from a wondrous sandbox (and it still is, sometimes!) to an astonishing exercise in efficiency maximization, complete with exploiting the game engine's tick rate and a stock market. And of course, as always with the systems we live in, the acquisition of the company and how that seems to inevitably leak the bottom line into the player experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yes, most importantly, the fact that I &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; this game despite all that, and how I think it's a monument to what screwing around with a computer and your imagination can do for the world. I'm not sure what the exact pathway was, but I probably wouldn't be interested in writing or computers were it not for Runescape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I almost didn't write this. To some large degree, this blog &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; my professional profile, and I was acutely embarrassed to be writing about something so juvenile even as I've just entered my 30s. I don't even &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; it anymore. At least my issues with the engineering world are &lt;em&gt;mature&lt;/em&gt;, in topic if not in tone. But on the other hand, who cares? We're talking about a game where you click on rocks for hundreds of hours! Strap in for some nostalgia and contemplation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i-a-brief-history"&gt;I. A Brief History&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game has already lived through three iterations. There was the original &lt;em&gt;Runescape Classic&lt;/em&gt;, now defunct, released in 2001, which looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Runescape Classic.jpg" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/e9d4e6e1.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh baby, those are some cutting-edge graphics. I never played this version of the game, but I have to admit that it isn't quite as bad as I remembered. &lt;em&gt;Classic&lt;/em&gt; was developed by two brothers and originally hosted out of their parent's house in Nottingham, which is delightful software lore. It reminds me very much of reading about the Discworld Multi-User Dungeon (a MUD; or text-based MMO) &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld_MUD"&gt;struggles with finding a home&lt;/a&gt; in the pre-cloud days:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MUD was later hosted for a time at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut by one of its undergraduates: Michael "Bastian" Hammill. "Bastian" served as chief administrator of the game and "god" of Discworld (a character role), while "Pinkfish" continued in his capacity as head game developer. The school's IT administrator eventually ruled the project a hacking attempt due to multiple UNIX rlogin attempts from across the globe. This was actually just the game developers, or "creators", working as part of an international programming effort. The mistake cost the MUD another one of its homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004, they released &lt;em&gt;Runescape 2&lt;/em&gt;, which looks like this and immediately transports me to my childhood, clicking away happily but with minimal comprehension on my grandfather's computer, which I hazily recall was running Windows 98.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Runescape 2.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/b0252706.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn't even find an image of the game from when I used to play it, as I'm pretty sure that fellow in blue on the far left of the image was only added when I was in high school. I probably sank hundreds of hours into the game as a kid, which I regretted not spending on mathematics until I was 26, at which point I decided productivity obsession is for dorks. My first character was &lt;em&gt;blastoise46&lt;/em&gt; who has sadly been lost to the dreadful and manifold hazards of forgetting my password, forgetting which of my parents let me use their email address to make the account, and customer support never getting back to me on account recovery options&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I stopped playing, but the game kept growing and the original company was acquired. They come out with Runescape 3, which looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Runescape 3.jpg" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/3aae92e2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've barely touched this, but despite looking much better, there's something off about it. It is mechanically improved in countless ways over the original, but in others ways it never sat right with me, like someone polished up the game without realizing what parts made it so charming in the first place. It's a strange, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtransaction"&gt;microtransaction&lt;/a&gt;-laden, gambling-encouraging mess, a part of my childhood resurrected into a well-dressed but nonetheless obviously-a-zombie that is lurching towards my wallet instead of my brains&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the developers release &lt;em&gt;Runescape 2&lt;/em&gt; once more, this time under the name &lt;em&gt;Old School Runescape&lt;/em&gt;, restoring the game to its state circa 2007. It's usually called &lt;em&gt;OSRS&lt;/em&gt; these days, and I'll largely be talking about &lt;em&gt;OSRS&lt;/em&gt; or the older &lt;em&gt;Runescape 2&lt;/em&gt; for the rest of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-scams"&gt;II. Scams&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The absolute first and most valuable thing you learn playing &lt;em&gt;OSRS&lt;/em&gt; is that the world has some fucking bastards in it, that will say or do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; to benefit at your expense if they believe they aren't going to get caught. That's a rough thing to learn as a kid - and the internet is replete with accounts of people recalling how much they wept the first time someone stole their stuff in the game - but I'm sure glad I learned it with fake video game armor instead of NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most famous scam was probably the old "trimming armor" trick, and the &lt;em&gt;spirit&lt;/em&gt; of this trick underlies most of the way that people are going to try to steal your money. You see, all armor came in two variants - the normal version, and the gold-trimmed version. They looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="osrs_armor_difference.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/0b22a24b.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The armor on the right, the "trimmed" version, was much rarer. The only issue with this is that there was absolutely no difference between these two sets of armor mechanically. Yes, one of these &lt;em&gt;looked&lt;/em&gt; superficially better, but people were rational enough that they weren't going to spend piles of money on something that is exactly the same but more painful to lose when you died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just kidding, people were the same back then, the armor on the right was worth &lt;em&gt;infinity dollars&lt;/em&gt;. But of course, with so many kids around and the concept of &lt;em&gt;Googling&lt;/em&gt; things being a little bit hazier, most players had no idea how the gold-trimmed armor was produced. The truth is you &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; produce it, it comes as a rare reward for doing certain activities in-game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you would run into in basically &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; town in the game was someone saying "Trimming armor!", "Trimming armor for free!", or possibly "Trimming armor 5k!".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="armour-meme.jpg" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/7de4a48a.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would hand the player your armor, whereupon they would either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promptly log out, never to be seen again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hang around and rub their victory in your face&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't remember if this was actually the scam that made me realize how this particularly ugly part of the human soul operates, but it must have been something like this, and in retrospect a suit of fake mithril armor for such an incredible lesson was one of the best deals I've ever made. I must thank the scammer for it, wherever that dickhead is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young children do not actually perform any calculations around whether they're likely to lose their items when they hand them over - they just hand them over and are absolutely &lt;em&gt;astonished&lt;/em&gt; to see that someone would simply take the item and disappear, cackling. To most children, this is a novel human experience, and for the first time you realize that there are people with calculated malice that you cannot fathom, and that there are domains where the God-figures of teachers and parents cannot answer prayers. Yes, you may cry, but you are met by baffled incomprehension and platitudes, but &lt;em&gt;not your stuff back&lt;/em&gt; which is what you actually want. Ya fucked up, kid, sorry, happens to the best of us. Children are easily overwhelmed by their excitement and credulity. But there are some lessons to ponder even looking back as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Last Psychiatrist&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is a blog with a few fascinating, if somewhat incoherent, articles on human psychology. One that I ran into early at university was &lt;a href="https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2013/05/dove.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dove Sketches Beauty Scam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which illustrated to me the value in occasionally being taken for a ride, particularly in amounts you can afford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If some street hustler challenges you to a game of three card monte you don't need to bother to play, just hand him the money, not because you're going to lose but because you owe him for the insight: he selected you.  Whatever he saw in you everyone sees in you, from the dumb blonde&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; at the bar to your elderly father you've dismissed as out of touch, the only person who doesn't see it is you, which is why you fell for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players were rarely hand-picked for the scam above (it was mostly blindfired into the masses and you'd let them self-select, like a Twitter account pumping NFTs), but there are still things to reflect on and learn from. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="armour-meme.jpg" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/7de4a48a.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice how he &lt;em&gt;isn't wearing gold-trimmed armor&lt;/em&gt;? That's because people that could actually afford it didn't need to scam people for money! But kids get excited and flustered, and the next thing they know they've been unceremoniously welcomed to the real world - so glad you could join us, we keep the financial anxiety in the cupboard to your left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, adults are a lot smarter than this, and would certainly notice the incongruity of someone who claims to be able to produce something incredibly valuable day in and day out, but instead opts to stand around extolling their virtues and begging people to purchase it for a relative pittance instead of earning millions directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, I'm a world-class business leader, and I've decided to make my very real secrets available to you for the low, low price of A$50 if you want my book or A$10,000 for a speaking engagement. If you'd like, I could also fill in as your CEO for say, a million dollars, and this company will have an &lt;em&gt;embarrassment&lt;/em&gt; of profits, like you wouldn't believe. Oh, yes, I have plenty of experience running Salesforce migrations, and they were all successful even though you've never seen a successful one before. I'll do that for you &lt;em&gt;instead&lt;/em&gt; of using that astonishing capability to repeatedly &lt;em&gt;actually generate&lt;/em&gt; incalculable revenue and paying myself out of that. Out of the kindness of my heart, xoxo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Thought leaders" are, fundamentally, just saying "trimming companies for $500,000", and Runescape gave me the antibodies I need to &lt;em&gt;not buy that&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are other things to reflect on too. The property of a system that allows you to simply take someone's money and proverbially log out is &lt;em&gt;explicitly&lt;/em&gt; supported by the cryptocurrency ecosystem, which &lt;em&gt;literal children&lt;/em&gt; can tell you is a bad thing after the old armour trimming shenanigans, but miraculously is talked about as a largely positive trait instead of something &lt;em&gt;extremely bad outside of very narrow circumstances&lt;/em&gt;. Yes, the government will take your money in some places, &lt;em&gt;but so will armour trimmers and you won't have any recourse&lt;/em&gt;. Plus, a malevolent actor can still take your money with the highly sophisticated "crowbar to your knees until we stop getting invalid passwords" attack&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I credit witnessing the endless profusion of scams in Runescape with laying the foundation for my critical thinking as an adult. There's a lot to learn from the threefold insights of realizing that truly shameless thieves exist, that some systems support their existence, and that &lt;em&gt;there are systems inside your head&lt;/em&gt; that make you more likely to be taken in if you let them run wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-problem-shallowness"&gt;III. Problem Shallowness&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a catchy saying in software engineering going by the name of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law"&gt;Linus's Law&lt;/a&gt; despite being written by a guy called Raymond. It is usually presented as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, framed in terms of real-world application, if &lt;em&gt;enough people look at a thing&lt;/em&gt;, the probability that someone will have the correct two neurons primed to immediately understand and solve the problem approaches 100%. This is something that I had mostly assumed to be true in the video gaming community, which is why the re-release of &lt;em&gt;OSRS&lt;/em&gt; has been startling to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game was &lt;em&gt;hardly&lt;/em&gt; unpopular, and while a large proportion of the playerbase was certainly quite young, there were many adults playing even in the early 2000s. I distinctly recall chatting, at the ripe age of 12, with a French elevator technician named &lt;em&gt;omlette2112&lt;/em&gt;, and I'm not sure why that is seared into my brain. My assumption would have been that something approximating optimal play would have been achieved relatively quickly, &lt;em&gt;particularly&lt;/em&gt; in a game where the main combat mechanic is simply click on monsters and waiting until they die, while periodically using a healing item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the last time I read something about the game, there was reference to a phenomenon known as "prayer flicking", which simply &lt;em&gt;did not exist&lt;/em&gt; when I used to play, and it is absolutely wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By way of explanation, players have access to a powerful set of temporary buffs that drain a resource called "prayer points". The most powerful example are typically called "overhead" prayers, buffs so strong that they appear above your character's head to indicate that they have become totally immune to an incoming damage type. This character is currently using &lt;em&gt;Protect From Melee&lt;/em&gt; and can't be hurt by anything other than an arrow or a spell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="overhead-melee.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/43490754.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, these drain your prayer points pretty quickly, otherwise people would just walk around immune to damage all day. Most enemies &lt;em&gt;only deal&lt;/em&gt; one damage type, so they just can't hurt you at all. Hah, yeah, it would be absolutely nuts if someone found a way to just become immune to damage indefinitely. Half the content would become obsolete overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know where this is going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players worked out that the game updates its state once every 0.6 seconds (a "game tick"), for a total of 100 updates a minute. And if you turned your prayers on and off on &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the game ticks where your character was going to receive damage, then you would get the immunity forever &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; never lose prayer points because the prayer wouldn't be on during the tick where the points should be drained. Huge portions of the game are now balanced around the fact that players are going to be immune to entire damage categories for extended periods of time, and a large amount of early content is completely obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not even really sure how to think about this, because I am &lt;em&gt;unsurprised&lt;/em&gt; that the concentrated power of the gaming world was able to brutally exploit an oversight in the game's original design, which again, was made by two brothers, the elder of whom was merely &lt;em&gt;twenty five&lt;/em&gt; upon the release of &lt;em&gt;Runescape 2&lt;/em&gt;. That makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is strange to me is that it &lt;em&gt;wasn't&lt;/em&gt; picked up in the earlier release of the game. I really thought we would have approached whatever critical mass of people you need to find the infinite health glitch back in the day. Yes, the playerbase is &lt;em&gt;much older&lt;/em&gt; now, but still! There were many people around, and even putting that aside, kids are shockingly intelligent when there are video games to be won. A quick check reveals that the truly demented Tetris innovation of &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/nes-tetris-players-call-it-rolling-and-theyre-setting-1846767518"&gt;rolling&lt;/a&gt; was invented by Christopher Martinez at the ripe old age of fourteen, and I imagine we had orders of magnitude more people playing Runescape than Tetris. Still, interesting to think about - it's a profoundly hopeful thought that it's still possible to work hard and come up with novelties in a field that you would expect to be picked clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, that doesn't tell the whole story, because prayer flicking this way could require players to be clicking for twice every 0.6 seconds, which would be unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, just kidding, &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; that's what people have been doing. The human spirit is fucking indomitable, which is why we're going straight the hell back to the goddamn moon, you alien bastards, and why we spend thousands of hours collectively learning how to time our double clicks to preserve resources in an online game. This is &lt;em&gt;the same facet of the human soul&lt;/em&gt; and you can't have one without the other. One day a human is going to be building the first human habitation on Mars, and at that moment there will be an &lt;em&gt;equally dedicated&lt;/em&gt; sicko on earth working out how to improve his damage output in Runescape 7 by 5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more concerning note, here is a thirty second video &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CP5OasEiS4"&gt;demonstrating how to use animated elements on the UI to time your clicks correctly&lt;/a&gt;. Now imagine someone doing that for anywhere between a minute to an hour because it's more efficient than playing the game the way it was originally intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at university, one of my philosophy lecturers made the argument that performance enhancing drugs leave professional athletes back where they started (relative to each other) except with drug-induced side effects. Each individual athlete might want drugs to be removed from the sport and to stop taking drugs themselves, but there's no way to stop this from happening due to the incentive structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I'm saying is that it seems &lt;em&gt;crazy&lt;/em&gt; that everyone added "click about four times a second" as a requirement to play large portions of their favorite game, and forced the designer to work around this, but &lt;em&gt;here we are&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-stonks"&gt;IV. Stonks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="stonks.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/136b8282.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way that the game &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to work when I was at school is that all trading between players happened manually. That is to say, you would log into the server named "World 1" and travel to a city called Varrock. You would then be greeted by up to two thousand people shouting out whatever they were buying or selling, and it was up to you to wade through that endless morass for whatever you wanted. I've frequently wondered how these norms are formed, but it was a fascinating exercise in self-organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="world_one.webp" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/1b2890e3.webp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back on all that weird, glowing text types that the developers made available, I can only say: "Wow, that is some 2004 energy." It's the sort of thing that is probably totally unwise to spend developer time on, it would not survive thirty seconds of feature prioritization at a more mature organization (even if I was doing doing the prioritization), and nonetheless all those sensible people must gaze on, absolutely stunlocked, as they fail to understand that terrible decisions like this are the fundamental magic, encoded a million times across what is probably a worse codebase than anything I've ever seen, that makes Runescape invincible and that puts so many well-reasoned experiences in the bargain bin of history through no fault of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, trying to buy items like this was quite the ordeal, and it was typically a lot simpler to &lt;em&gt;actually play the game&lt;/em&gt; and try to acquire things yourself than it was to stand around asking for them. But this also felt unsatisfactory, because sometimes you'd really want to buy something and would have no idea how to convert all that hard-earned money into useful stuff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter the &lt;a href="https://runescape.wiki/w/Grand_Exchange"&gt;Grand Exchange&lt;/a&gt; in 2007. The chaos of trading manually and desperately trying to draw attention to yourself was replaced with a bunch of people standing around, largely totally silently, placing orders on the fantasy stock exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="grand_exchange.jpg" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/cdb4d37e.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a certain nostalgia for the good old days where people actually hung around and talked to each other, but in retrospect that's hardly communication. It's mostly a bunch of people spamming as rapidly as possible when they'd much rather be doing something else, with too much noise for the possibility of a friendship to even develop after the transaction. But it did do something &lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt; weird to the game, which is that it became &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; easy to rapidly convert any given resource into any &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; resource, which means that to some degree, all activities are now fungible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is to say, I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; go fletch a bunch of arrows to practice my archery, but it would be a lot easier to kill a bunch of cows because cow hides have undergone a massive price boost then convert those into &lt;em&gt;thousands&lt;/em&gt; of arrows within a few minutes. On the bright side, I've saved myself a lot of time! On the not so bright side, I've sort of... sidestepped engaging with the game systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose I don't have much of a problem with this, really, but I did think it was interesting how quickly I stopped playing the game after this update, even though it was basically a pure upgrade to my experience in material terms. There's probably some broader, very deep lesson here about how friction is an important part of some experiences. It brings to mind how, while having such an incredible ecosystem of Python libraries enables massive productivity, I always feel like I'm missing out by having the responsible solution to so many interesting problems be "use someone else's solution for it". Or all the time spent drilling footwork in fencing. While it seems &lt;em&gt;obvious&lt;/em&gt; that I'd prefer that time back, and a Matrix-machine that downloads the preliminary steps into our brains so that beginners can enjoy the sport immediately would be great, I also can't help but feel that something very important would be lost alongside it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, this feeling is so widespread that a game mode was released whose largest restriction is that you can't use the fantasy stock market. People will pay for an account to &lt;em&gt;turn the friction back on&lt;/em&gt; because the friction &lt;em&gt;is the experience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v-on-releasing-trash"&gt;V. On Releasing Trash&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a wonderful lesson for people that feel their work isn't good enough to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The absolute worst skill in any game is Runescape's Firemaking skill. The original iteration, which stuck around for years, was so mind-bogglingly stupid that I still get vaguely triggered thinking about it. It's crazy that the game went through three iterations and they &lt;em&gt;never fixed the fundamental flaws with the skill&lt;/em&gt;, though they did eventually introduce some a minigame that let you more-or-less skip the skill entirely, which probably tells you all you need to know about how bad it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect I know how it came about - the original developers imagined a large open-world with survival mechanisms, and making a fire is how you would fend off starvation and the elements. This is because every time my friends and I got together in primary school and brainstormed a game, we'd always end up with something like this. But there is no weather in Runescape, nor is there hunger, and the world is so small that it's fairly trivial to just walk to the nearest storage location and grab stockpiled food instead - you almost never need to cook food on an open fire. But they kept the Firemaking skill in anyway, because that's the sort of thing you do when you're designing a game to host from your parent's house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead you've got a whole skill dedicated to settings logs on fire, with higher levels allowing you to set rare logs alight. The entire skill starts and ends with clicking on a tinderbox then clicking on some logs. At a rough guess, it probably takes around a &lt;em&gt;hundred&lt;/em&gt; hours of repeatedly clicking on a tinderbox then logs to get your skill to the highest possible level. And of course, the benefit of lighting higher level logs is...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N o t h i n g .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn't do a damn thing. Doesn't cook the food any better. Doesn't even burn longer, which would have been useless anyway since the normal logs last for long enough but &lt;em&gt;how did this get overlooked?&lt;/em&gt; It's actually strictly &lt;em&gt;inferior&lt;/em&gt; to have to leverage high level Firemaking because the trees are much rarer, and the fancy logs would have sold for more on the market. They just slapped this one in there and let it rip, and even made it compulsory to engage by gating quests behind the skill. Quests that usually don't even rely on the Firemaking mechanic! The game is riddled with all sorts of strange things like this, such as archery consisting of a single skill that determines your accuracy and damage, but melee combat being split into Attack (accuracy) and Strength (damage) for absolutely no reason.  These are totally unparsimonious design decisions, and you know what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That's fine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game did £120M in 2022, remember? People &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; it. Even making allowances for some of that revenue being driven by things like microtransactions, it's obviously a huge hit. It would probably be &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; if these things had been ironed out when it wasn't too late, but they just shipped the thing and didn't sweat all of those details too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot to be said for the broad skill of &lt;em&gt;Practicing Finishing&lt;/em&gt;, but it's probably why the ability to &lt;em&gt;Ship Something&lt;/em&gt; is valued so highly in engineering circles. Most people struggle to finish, whether it's writing a book or a piece of software, and that desire to flesh out every little flaw is frequently one of the major reasons. If they worried about all these details, they probably would have worked out that a browser game could never have lived up to their expectations, and the world would be down one huge collective experience. Some things have to be perfect, but &lt;em&gt;almost everything&lt;/em&gt; doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vi-bots"&gt;VI. Bots&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game used to be packed to the brim with strange bald men in dark green pants. They all looked exactly like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="bot.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/d1ef2d8d.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because the game was, and still is, &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; heavily botted. That is the default character. Just a million of these little guys zooming around, funneling endless piles of resources into the game's economy, mostly for the purpose of selling players in-game currency in exchange for real money. You'd frequently see them stacked up on top of each other on the exact same spot, all the lowest level, with absolute nonsense names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="bots_2.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/ed8895a3.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first introduction to the idea of computer-assisted automation, and while I never botted myself, it was very direct exposure to the idea of an adversarial relationship existing between application developers and attackers. I suspect a great many of the people that converted the output from these bots into real-world money became the same people that try to launch attacks against our EC2 instances in an attempt to mine Ethereum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details on how the Runescape team tackles botting are very hazy, but I know enough to understand that they have developed a fairly high level of sophistication in-house, probably aided by the massive volumes of training data from the number of bots around. But it really is battling something like a serious criminal enterprise - it is not uncommon for accounts with paid memberships to get stolen through third-party database leaks. I &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; get phishing emails every so often trying to get ahold of an account I haven't touch in ten years. It's hard to know exactly how much money changes hands, but given that the people involved seem to have some level of technical ability and real money is involved, I am guessing that at least one person has genuinely been assassinated in developing countries over disrupting the bald men chopping down trees in the fantasy game, which is a fucking &lt;em&gt;insane&lt;/em&gt; sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is largely why I was extremely paranoid from day one when I heard about the concept of compromising a machine to mine cryptocurrency. I had firsthand experience &lt;em&gt;watching&lt;/em&gt; people exploit holes in systems to accumulate tiny amounts of money en masse. If there is a way to get $0.00000001 out of a system programatically, some guy is going to work out how to do it enough times to buy himself a car in the best case or a yacht in the worst case, but it'll be your money either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vii-efficiencyscape-and-money"&gt;VII. EfficiencyScape and Money&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was brought to my attention a few years ago that Jagex had lifted any restrictions on "multiplaying", i.e, the act of logging into multiple accounts at the same time. My recollection is that this was disallowed when I used to play, as the idea was that it was unfair for one player to gather resources at several times the officially allowed rate. In fact, I believe it was &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; forbidden to even trade between your own accounts when I used to play - another life lesson was sometimes asking a friend to serve as a mule between two of your accounts, and their child-brains being overwhelmed at holding all your money, whereupon they would just decide to keep it and they'd never speak to you again. I can't remember if I ever &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; this to anyone, but I learn towards imagining I did and vowing to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be that guy again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now not unusual to see people logging into &lt;em&gt;several&lt;/em&gt; paid accounts at the same time, which could cost anywhere between $30 to $100 a month depending on how many characters you're juggling at the same time. The Youtubers I've seen who still play the game make frequent reference to playing more than one character at a time as if this is totally normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose the first thing that's whacky is seeing that people are so hellbent on maximizing their efficiency that they're literally willing to pay to play multiple instance of the same game &lt;em&gt;simultaneously&lt;/em&gt;. But you know, power to them, whatnot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the broader observation is that I can only assume this has been done because it allows the developers to earn way more money per player than they otherwise would, and I figure this must coincide with their numerous acquisitions over the years. It's sad to see, but I suppose people with millions of dollars to throw around don't acquire companies because they're passionate about the game, they do it because someone convinced them that the customers can be tapped for more money under new management. The suits involved probably don't even really understand the game, and instead get a vague rundown which fails to capture any nuance, entirely focused on the number of recurring subscriptions the product has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has manifested in a few astonishing blunders, such as a widely anticipated complete graphical overhaul being &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/runelite-hd-shut-down/"&gt;banned&lt;/a&gt; because the parent company was considering working on their own graphical overhaul at some undefined date in the distant future, which was eventually walked back in the face of massive protests. Things like this happen a lot in the gaming community, such as &lt;a href="https://press-start.com.au/news/playstation/2024/05/06/sony-is-walking-back-helldivers-2s-controversial-account-changes/"&gt;Sony getting absolutely owned&lt;/a&gt; over their decision to force Helldivers 2 players to have a PSN account, and the absolute nerds over at Wizards of the Coast &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/dungeons-and-dragons-has-walked-back-its-huge-ogl-mistake-but-the-damage-is-already-done/"&gt;getting obliterated&lt;/a&gt; over trying to make modifications to Dungeons and Dragons' famous Open Gaming License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favourite thing about the last is that Matt Mercer, who has done a huge amount for Dungeon and Dragons' profile over the past few years, seems to have taken the opportunity to create his own game, &lt;a href="https://www.daggerheart.com/"&gt;Daggerheart&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn't seem that interesting on first glance &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; it's crazy that some executive that didn't understand the community has decided to roll the dice on existential risk to a &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; profitable piece of IP. People &lt;em&gt;really, really&lt;/em&gt; want their games to be more like Matt Mercer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, behaviour like this shouldn't be terribly surprising from a company that sometimes supports &lt;a href="https://runescape.wiki/w/Squeal_of_Fortune"&gt;microtransactions and in-game gambling&lt;/a&gt;, but it's astonishing how &lt;em&gt;incompetently&lt;/em&gt; it was executed. To quote The Dark Knight, this city deserves a better class of criminal. But then again, maybe we should be grateful that the blast radius is limited by all the incompetents involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="viii-all-the-good-stuff"&gt;VIII. All The Good Stuff&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's clearly some dystopian commentary to be made on adults grinding out hundreds of hours clicking on rocks for levels in a game, but there's a bunch of entirely wholesome stuff to come out of the game too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, it certainly cheered me up on many, many days as a kid when I was having a miserable time at school, and I have no idea how I'd have managed without that little bit of escapism. I must concede sadly that the new version of the game, where people use tick manipulation with knives and logs and axes to train two skills may not scratch that itch, but the original version of the game was something to behold. It's the only reason that I know that bronze is an alloy of copper and tin, that the end of an arrow is called fletching, and a thousand other little facts. And when I was deep in burnout&lt;sup id="fnref:8"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, I somehow ended up watching challenge playthrough from Jeporite where &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQahsBowqYk"&gt;he tries to play the entire game while restricted to a tiny section of the map&lt;/a&gt;, and it &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; got me through some rough times despite being absolutely stupid as a concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soundtrack is phenomenal and varied, and they've gone so far as to re-record some of the original MIDI soundtracks with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLWTiPLelYc"&gt;an actual orchestra&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, it still absolutely slaps, although I have no idea what it sounds like to someone didn't condition themselves on it for hundreds of hours when their brains were still developing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More broadly, I look back on the game as a spectacular, varied, imperfect work of passion. It has gone through so, so many iterations, ranging from the original DeviousMUD&lt;sup id="fnref:7"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="devious_mud.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/5d3c9938.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the way to the latest iteration. If there's any doubt about that, just take a look at the world map used for the above version of the game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="original_map.jpg" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/aea15480.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This little hand-drawn map is &lt;em&gt;brimming&lt;/em&gt; with the energy which made the game the massive success that it is, which enraptured hundreds of thousands of kids across the world, and it is perhaps not terribly surprising that men and women in suits have trouble understanding that. I mean, &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; at it. It's dreadful, yet it is absolutely a better sales pitch for the game than any number of professional designers without any soul in the game can produce, which is why Runescape is a huge success and a dozen other MMOs with bigger budgets disappear every year. That core of passion is still baked in there, right next to the freehand square labelled 'Haunted House' with no additional context. The game &lt;em&gt;oozes&lt;/em&gt; it. There's a whole feature where you can manually grind wheat in a windmill to create flour so that you can bake bread, an extremely slow and stupid process that basically &lt;em&gt;no one ever uses&lt;/em&gt; because bread is worthless level one garbage, but it's in there because it sounded fun to the original developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some of the developers there are the most &lt;em&gt;beloved&lt;/em&gt; figures I've seen in any online community. &lt;em&gt;OSRS&lt;/em&gt; has one person in particular, known as Mod Ash, who has been around since the very early days, and it is not an exaggeration to say that Mod Ash leaving the company on bad terms poses an &lt;em&gt;existential threat&lt;/em&gt; to the business. If he were to get hired by a competing product and fully endorse it, many players might flock away, because his absolute commitment to the game and community over the years is considered to be beyond question at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe he's the product manager for the game these days. Punching his name into YouTube yields &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPOY0hB7c-E"&gt;"How Mod Ash Became The World's Favorite Developer"&lt;/a&gt;. The comments say things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish Ash knew how much he meant to us. I truly hope he does.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I flew to Runefest from Sweden all alone just to get a picture with him. He is the Legend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; seen people talk about a &lt;em&gt;product manager&lt;/em&gt; that way? I know this community, they're usually &lt;em&gt;feral ghouls&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Get on his fucking level&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do write quite a lot on doing meaningful work, but it's interesting to think about what that actually looks like. It's easy to imagine working on cancer cures, but compared to producing PowerBI reports, many things are valuable. They just need to align with a passion you have, once your other financial needs are both met and, ideally, minimized. For someone like Mod Ash, that's evidently treating one video game in the most soulful way a person can manage. Maybe the most important obligation that we have is simply to &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; publish a game built off the map we doodled, or indeed, to write a blog post about a game from your childhood, or to otherwise do the thing that you know you want to but are holding back from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will McAskill once said, in defense of Effective Altruism, that the world can basically absorb infinite amounts of money and continue improving outcomes linearly - that is, two mosquito nets is twice as good as one mosquito net for a &lt;em&gt;very, very large&lt;/em&gt; value of mosquito notes, but this is not true of buying yourself expensive cars. Whatever your feelings on the EA movement, that seems to be fairly obviously true. Similarly, I suspect that the world as it is has a &lt;em&gt;limitless&lt;/em&gt; capacity to absorb authenticity and keep producing better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was going to sign off with the observation that one of the game's original founders, Andrew Gower, has had a mystery company that has had no output despite existing for &lt;em&gt;fourteen years&lt;/em&gt;, and I was going to use it as an example of how extreme talent or vision doesn't lend itself to a repeat success. But it turns out that since I last looked last year, he announced what looks to be (essentially) &lt;a href="https://www.brightershores.com/"&gt;Runescape 4, or Brighter Shores&lt;/a&gt;, presumably produced with the millions of pounds he got from the original acquisition but while retaining complete creative control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I going to play it? &lt;em&gt;Probably not&lt;/em&gt;, I think (sadly) the period of my life where my imagination ran so wild that I could be enraptured by pixels and MIDI soundtracks has run its course, and I'm busy these days. Busy with things I love for the most part, yes, but there's something bittersweet in not having the time to love more things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I'm glad that those mad bastards might let another generation of kids have the opportunity to let their imaginations run wild, and (lamentably but necessarily) get scammed. My accommodation during this trip to Fiji is right next to a school, and I can hear that generation right now, screaming at the top of their lungs and kicking a ball around the schoolyard while their teachers desperately try to keep them under control. Godspeed, you snot-nosed monsters, and I hope you have as much fun as I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned 30 today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've taken a few stabs at this post, and nothing came out feeling right. I wanted to write about Terry Pratchett, the writing process itself, programming, improv theater, career nonsense, direction, and all the other bits in life that warrant reflection. Normally I try very hard to try and narrow my writing down to a single topic - just imagine how chaotic they'd be without that! - but my birthday present to myself is that I'm going to write about whatever the fuck&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I want, in whatever way I want, and everyone's gonna have to take it or leave it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's probably meta-commentary on what happens when you get older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first version of this post opened with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I write this, I'm slated to turn thirty in about forty eight hours. It's going to happen while I'm out in Fiji on vacation, which, to my thinking, seems like a very reasonable way to go about dying &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; slowly, i.e, aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has now been forty eight hours, and I am indeed in Fiji. However, instead of the imagined reality of sitting back and relaxing, preferably with some sort of iced, fruity drink, I slept fitfully, removed a few cockroaches for my girlfriend, then spent the first few hours of my day at Animals Fiji, where I helped time the heartbeat of a cat that had probably ingested rat poison&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, unloaded a box of saline solution for the logistics manager, then held an I.V bag overhead for the same cat as it was transferred to a new cage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the first lesson, and what I anticipated when I wrote last year, is that life never goes according to plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second lesson is that it's more interesting that way (even if you're quite sleep-deprived).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third lesson is that sometimes, if you're willing to give up some cocktails and instead put on some gloves, you can help a cat. These are little things, but despite being little, they are not &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time spent working: approximately three minutes. Good done for the world: higher than &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; I've ever done professionally. Even the few times I've made a huge impact on the bottom line, those savings were usually immediately thrown away on something else. Makes a guy think, and on the very special day where he's prone to thinking deeply anyway, that leads to dangerous places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-29"&gt;II. 29&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are worse places to start than reading over last year's reflections. I'm glad I have them around, and I only wish I'd had them going back to age eighteen. We try to pretend everything before that didn't happen. In any case, what was up last year and how have I gotten wiser?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In five years, if all goes well, I'm supposed to be running a small software consultancy with my closest friends and to be a licensed clinical psychologist. I would be 34. My attention is drawn immediately to two things. One, that both does major events start with the good ol' if all goes well. If all goes well, I'd run my own business and have an extremely prestigious clinical qualification, and if my grandmother had wheels then she'd be a bicycle. It's chaos all the way through, and life is driven entirely by that chaos, punctuated by brief periods of predictability where I might successfully make a few cups of tea
[...]
I have concrete plans for the future, and the main thing I've learned in 29 years is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to make predictions, especially about the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it turns out I'm wise as hell. I incidentally didn't gain entry into a psychology program in 2024, and the sheer cost (A$60,000!) combined with the amount of preparatory work I would need to do in order to compete with the other applicants (extensive volunteering, frequently with the assistance of wealthy parents) is quite off-putting. I'm not sure if I'll apply for 2025. On one hand, mental health is something I care deeply about, but A$60,000 is a lot of money. And I am still suspicious of plans that start with "I'll pay someone a lot of money and then things will have more meaning".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="facts_of_life.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/08664183.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, I have spent an unhealthy amount of time over the past year thinking about corporate dynamics, and I highly recommend that people, including myself, touch grass more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent less time worrying about workplace dynamics and happiness last year, so that's good. Most of the writing on the topic since then, especially lately, has been in response to particularly &lt;em&gt;acute&lt;/em&gt; instances of things I can't abide, and they're usually gone from my mind within a few moments of getting all the words onto a page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; is that I don't worry about these things because they're wastes of time. Organizational change is very rare, and I've only seen a version of it that I believe at one company, where they replaced a non-technical CEO with someone that I believed has contributed to the Linux kernel. I am neither well-positioned to become a CEO (though I &lt;em&gt;bet&lt;/em&gt; that I could scrounge up a gross amount of VC money even now) and I'm not at that level technically. It's mud, it's pointless, it's almost all people cosplaying at software engineering. We're genuinely in the midst of some sort of crazy crypto-rush but it's the entire software industry, which is why people are being allocated hundreds of millions of dollars to hire engineers that do everything in Excel. The jobs I've seen even since the &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/most-tech-jobs-are-jokes-and-i-am-not-laughing/"&gt;the last time I wrote&lt;/a&gt; have only gotten worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, someone ten years my senior asked if we could store our enterprise secrets in Google Sheets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are only two permanent jobs in Australia that I'm contemplating now, both where I have referrals from readers. Both of them would be stretches with my technical skill (the state of the industry means that almost all my learning is self-study or, more recently, mentorship from readers). Putting those two aside, I have no interest in pursuing permanent roles at large companies without someone inside them vouching for them. My CV now says I'm pretty much &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; open to contracting, as I'd rather be paid more money than less money if I'm going to be asked to do shuffle spreadsheets around all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-doing-good"&gt;III. Doing Good&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I attended the Melbourne Databricks meetup. Possibly a Meetup, I'm not sure what the etiquette is when you actually use the platform. I went with Sam Campbell, Eastern Health's Deputy Chief Data Officer&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and one of my company's co-founders. Lots of good things to say about Sam, ranging from his programming talent to friendship, but I'm going to leave those all out because you will see from the rest of this story that he is, to use the vernacular of the under 30 crowd, based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first speakers at the meetup are the slavering ghouls known as Tabcorp. I knew the name sounded familiar before turning up, but it turns out they are a gambling company, an industry that I presume is mostly filled by fucking bastards. The presentation did not disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were using Databricks to build an entire platform aimed at ensuring they have better real-time analytics around gambling behaviour. They said one sentence around the start of the talk about maybe stopping problem gamblers, complained a bit about harsh regulations (go fuck yourselves, you malevolent shitheads), and then proceeded to vomit incompetent engineering practice over the audience. A few minutes in, they talk about detecting the best moments to offer people better deals in real-time to prolong their gambling sessions, such as giving them discounts on the next go after a losing streak that might otherwise stop them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel sick writing this out, but apparently the term they use for such an offer is a &lt;em&gt;generosity&lt;/em&gt;. I'm unsure if this is used elsewhere, but in the context of gambling, this is violence to the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam leans over and very, very audibly whispers, "This is the fisherman calling the baited hook a gift", which is why I hang out with the guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, Tabcorp, it took me thirty seconds of looking at your diagrams to realize that you guys suck at data, have been conned by consultants, and the only thing that makes me feel better about the whole ordeal is that your platform will suck forever, and if I'm lucky, other unethical industries will copy your slack-jawed practices and suffer from similar inefficiencies. Truly, only by the grace of your incompetence are our most vulnerable people protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tabcorp takes up &lt;em&gt;fifty&lt;/em&gt; minutes of their scheduled... thirty. And then take another five minutes for questions even as the event organizers attempt to prevent their banshee-technicians from wailing sickening horrors into the crowd through a microphone. The talk was really quite bad. Well, I'm sure they didn't take the time from anyone that was -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh that's right, they took the time from fucking Red Cross, who were trying to talk about their state-of-the-art blood packaging facility. Can you imagine how fucking &lt;em&gt;stupid&lt;/em&gt; you have to be to represent a gambling company and take time from &lt;em&gt;Red Cross&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't get into the details of the Red Cross operation, but it was extremely impressive, and the talk indicated something I didn't expect to see at a non-profit - extreme caring and extreme competence, in a very complex domain. I'm going to try arrange a tour of the facility so that I can write about it, or possibly get one of the lead engineers onto the podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this did make me think though. So much of technology is sort of... nothing. The engineering industry is much smaller than it would seem based on market cap and what I call the Click-Ops-Monkey market is &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt;, but for some reason we've decided to call both roles engineering which leads to a lot of confusion. The former worry a lot about professional development, deep study, system design, and process. The latter plumb spreadsheets and breathlessly listen to people talking about how innovative they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then every so often, you see something like the Red Cross setup and think "Wow, that's &lt;em&gt;demonstrably&lt;/em&gt; going to save lives, and would have taken countless millions of dollars and cross-specialty collaboration to make happen. Is that a camera that tracks the packets down the line and runs OCR to see if the labels are smudged to prevent misdelivery? Why on earth is &lt;em&gt;Red Cross&lt;/em&gt; the place that showed me my first non-stupid machine learning project?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or consider this blogging platform, Mataroa. I am pretty sure it delivered my writing to approximately a million people last year. I mean, it really just facetanks the Hackernews hug of death effortlessly. Yes, it's just HTML, but do you know how many Click-Ops-Monkey teams would somehow create a React monstrosity that explodes on 5,000 concurrent users &lt;em&gt;for no reason&lt;/em&gt;? I raised an issue in the early days where my name was getting leaked (although it's a moot point now) and it was fixed within twenty minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They do all this on fucking &lt;a href="https://mataroa.blog/modus/transparency/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ninety dollars a month&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I'm over here fucking trying to desperately perform CPR on every data warehouse in Melbourne because the fucking clowns at Deloitte keep telling everyone that needs to be hand-crafted Lambda functions connected to spreadsheets connected to DynamoDB connected to Snowpipes connected to fucking &lt;em&gt;Javascript stored procedures&lt;/em&gt; connected to Snowflake tasks, running up half million dollar bills for &amp;lt;50 GB of CSV ingestion every day&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and some &lt;a href="https://github.com/sirodoht"&gt;fucking chad&lt;/a&gt; is addressing my emails with a twenty minute turnaround time for &lt;em&gt;ninety dollars&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even today, at the clinic. We made it to Fiji using planes, we stay cool because of air conditioning, we reach the clinic in a car, and I note that staff are operating decrepit X-Ray machines (that nonetheless get the job done) and have iPads even in Fiji for case management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one side of technology is the stuff that lets me read every book in the world, and communicate globally in the blink of an eye, and ensure that we know that your pets get dosed with the right medicine. It is limitless reach and connection and comfort and health. There is no disease on the planet that I am confident that technology will not one day disdainfully sweep from the face of the gameboard like a blundered knight. It is morphine for suffering cats, and getting your kid to the football game on time, and having access to Terry Pratchett from a small island in Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on the other side is a slate-gray machine whose teeth are chomping cubicles that mulch humans, whose fingers puppet empty suits that speak only of synergy, whose blood runs cold with cash and hot with nepotism, whose demands for soulless collaboration can steal the sun from you, whose eyes only ever read summaries of &lt;em&gt;The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People&lt;/em&gt;, whose cogitating mind crunches reality and emits LinkedIn posts, whose heart is fake innovation with murmurs of corruption, whose worshipers build heretic shrines to Elon Musk and Crypto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot to write about technology as a concept, but for now, it turns out turning 30 didn't mellow me out at all, and I'm &lt;em&gt;still at war&lt;/em&gt; with the latter. But now a professional has explained to me how much well-being can be accomplished with A$200,000 in medical supplies for animals in Fiji, so I'm even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; pissed off than I was before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes people pull this "You're immature" shtick when you get upset at the corporate world being the way it is. Those people are stupid bastards that haven't seen a veterinarian in the developing world explain that a (low) Click-Ops-Monkey salary in Melbourne could pay for &lt;em&gt;four thousand treatments&lt;/em&gt; for animals here. I'm not saying don't get paid well for your country, I'm saying &lt;em&gt;I will not accept paying a team of ten people to make PowerBI dashboards that no one will read&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Fuck that&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Can you tell I was very attached to the cat this morning?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to spend a lot more time figuring out how to do things like &lt;em&gt;save cats&lt;/em&gt; before I'm 40, and I'm going to spend a lot less time saving on Snowflake bills unless I can prevent the savings from being immediately wasted on bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-pratchett"&gt;IV. Pratchett&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On writing - writing this blog has changed my life in a lot of ways. I meet great people, I get lots of amazing mentorship and general education. Say what you will about unnecessary swearing, but it removes all the people that pearl-clutch. By the time someone gets to the end of one of these posts, if they still want to talk to me then we're in for a great time. It also helps me think very clearly on many things, and you would be astounded how much of good public speaking is simply having worked out a bunch of good phrases to trot out regularly - even people like the late Christopher Hitchens have an arsenal of zingers they fall back on when you've listened to enough of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only do I want to keep writing, I want to write a lot more. Certain authors have made a huge difference in my life, and I suspect Nassim Taleb and Terry Pratchett are the two who live the most rent-free in my head. They both unlocked my mind in fascinating ways, and sometimes I think that all the truth in the world is locked away in Pratchett.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pratchett deserves a whole post of his own (as does Taleb), so perhaps I'll leave it there. I would be lying if I said keeping this blog hasn't hurt my employability. It is possible that no large company will ever associate with me again, and the only thing keeping me employed is that employers are &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; lax that they probably won't discover my writing until after my probation has passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a goal before the age of 31 is to get an honest-to-God novel out. Years ago, I read David Edding's book, &lt;em&gt;The Rivan Codex&lt;/em&gt;, where he challenges readers to write a book within ten years if they really are "something of a writer". I laughed at that, but more than ten years have passed, and he was right! I didn't deliver. In any case, I've started writing and I hope to finish in a year. We'll see what happens, but I've gotten good at finishing things even if they aren't very good. And lots of people have asked me to take a stab at &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/praise-the-machine-spirit/"&gt;writing more fiction&lt;/a&gt;, and who am I to deny the people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(One of the most valuable pieces of advice I ever read was to &lt;em&gt;practice finishing&lt;/em&gt;, and that's why this blog gets tons of updates while my &lt;em&gt;previous&lt;/em&gt; one with an actual readership got one a year and fizzled.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a thing’s worth doing, it’s worth doing badly,” said Granny, fleeing into aphorisms, the last refuge of an adult under siege.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while we're at it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not worth doing something unless someone, somewhere, would much rather you weren't doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I would encourage everyone reading this to write. I get a lot of emails from people that think their writing isn't good or not original or whatever. Nah, just go for it. Even the paragraph above about cubicle-teeth, which I was quite proud of, is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; obviously inspired by Ginberg's &lt;a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49303/howl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Howl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Steal shamelessly, my friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v-on-compromising"&gt;V. On Compromising&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have to compromise on moral ideals sometimes. To quote Tom Lehrer: "You can't always break the rules, people who try are fools. When you get older, maybe then you will see."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; compromising, but I've done it. However, I read the &lt;a href="https://www.simplermachines.com/dont-lie-in-interviews/"&gt;following article on lying&lt;/a&gt; from friend of the blog, Nat Bennett.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm somewhat sympathetic to the "man I need the job" line but this "well a manager lied to me first?" thing – just play the fucking tape forward. Just put your anti-capitalist self-righteousness on hold for one goddamned second and think. If your model is "it's okay to lie if I've been lied to" then we're all knee deep in bullshit forever and can never escape Transaction Cost Hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This caused some consternation when people discussed it - in an industry where recruiters won't even talk to you unless you lie about your experience, how does one feed their family? I've been &lt;em&gt;very lucky&lt;/em&gt; in not having to lie, and frequently urge people around me to just change all the databases on their CV to &amp;lt;whatever-the-employer-is-using&amp;gt; because they &lt;em&gt;don't even know that SQL is mostly the same everywhere&lt;/em&gt;. If you write Postgres even &lt;em&gt;once&lt;/em&gt; on a CV, some employers will not talk to you, and there aren't enough jobs in Australia to write those employers off if you have kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is mostly self-indulgent nonsense, I do have a bit of actual advice that probably someone reading this is still early enough in their career that they haven't heard it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to be the kind of person who walks away from your job when you're asked to do something that doesn't fit your values, you need to save money. You need to maintain low fixed expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acting with integrity – or whatever it is that you value – mostly isn't about making the right decision in the moment. It's mostly about the decisions that you make leading up to that moment, that prepare you to be able to make the decision that you feel is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm that person, early enough in the careers to make use of this advice. I'm going to do my best to position myself for a good, ethical career now, before it's too late and I've got a mortgage and I'm three moves from financial checkmate. Hell, if I had been smarter when I was younger (big if, sure), I probably would have thought a lot more carefully before studying, worked a lot harder, possibly picked a different industry or country, and be blissfully unaware of how dumb the economy writ large is. I'd be out there tuning Kubernetes clusters so that people can run protein folding more effectively, or something like that. There's still time for me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'm going to make sure that my finances are in order, that I'm meeting good people, that my cost of living is low, and that's how I'll maintain the ability to be honest (but, yes, jobs I get through readers and friends probably aren't going to get blasted on here, assuming they aren't like, committing warcrimes in developing countries and are instead just using spreadsheets badly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vi-performance"&gt;VI. Performance&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll keep this one brief, as they probably deserve separate posts too. My music and improv lessons and really enriched my life over the past two years. I'm going to be performing on stage for the first time at Impro Melbourne's &lt;em&gt;Monster Of The Week&lt;/em&gt; show, probably on June 14th. Readers are welcome, tickets are very cheap as it's a student show! But I'm going to do a lot more of this going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also going to try and build up for a joint vocal-piano showcase at a student night at my music school, which for some reason is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; scarier than the improv theatre. A one hour totally unscripted show? My heart rate barely budges, your boy is just built different. Three minutes of piano playing with as many practice sessions as I want? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vii"&gt;VII.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About two weeks ago, my girlfriend threw a surprise party for me. She did this via the very clever trick of telling me there was going to be a small party, thus lowering my guard, then inviting many of my colleagues&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, my old fencing team, my classmates from psychology, and my improv group over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was weird seeing all those people in one place (in my head they existed in separate dimensions), but I also had a shocking moment where I realized how lucky I was to be able to fill twenty seats in a pub with people who:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made time on a weekday for me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are only the subset of people that my girlfriend knew how to contact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Didn't even comprise any family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been bullied for how doggedly I maintain my relationships&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but this is the first time I've ever seen the results of pouring all that energy out (sometimes a little bit too much) appear in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, more than anything else, I'm mostly hoping to keep being excellent to each other, all the way up to 40 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, in the spirit of practicing finishing, I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going to proofread this post and just &lt;em&gt;send it&lt;/em&gt;. Enjoy the typos, I'm going to be writing a book and reading in Fiji for three weeks! See you on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't even really feel like this curse was necessary, but that made it all the more important to the general sentiment.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My contribution amounted to thinking of pulling my phone out and starting a stopwatch, as my partner is used to have much fancier medical equipment around, and I'm too useless in a clinical setting to do anything other than hold things for professionals. No, no, don't think of me as a hero.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've seen enterprise systems that executives get on stage and brag about that would genuinely collapse if someone asked them to download one copy of Call of Duty every day - think about that.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People that desperately wish that I am secretly horrible to work with will be disappointed to note that most of my coworkers happily meet me outside of hours. Honestly, I'm not sure why either sometimes, but I'm grateful!&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slacked and I'm behind on fifty emails, going back to March 26th! I'll get to everyone eventually now that I only get one or two a week! Just pray nothing hits #1 on Hackernews for a bit, for my sake.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:6" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Well, I don't really have a reason to beg for money, lacking an unprofitable idea to beeline for an IPO&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; with, but I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; find myself really wanting to write about this. Starting with all the hacking I did at university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have many, mostly vaguely negative, feelings towards university, which many people find odd coming from someone that did exceedingly well at it. The majority of the experience can best be summarized as occasionally having the privilege of being near extremely smart teachers and students, but &lt;em&gt;most of the time&lt;/em&gt; I was being lavishly praised for doing very easy things, while watching the majority of my peers desperately flounder, and from time-to-time being forced to appease a confused authority figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was my experience through the entirety of my psychology degree, and I thought I.T would be much more serious. In retrospect, the most valuable thing that I learned at university - though it took me a while to figure it out - is that the world outside of academia behaves approximately as stupidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us explore this dysfunction, starting with the lessons I learned from getting a perfect score on a machine learning competition then being asked to bury having done so to save everyone face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you read in horror, remember that I attended Monash University&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, which is one of the best in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i"&gt;I.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must begin with introducing my adversary, The Great Lecturer, The Beast With A Thousand Slides Who Writes Code That Does Not Compile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, I was one year into my Masters degree in data science. Coming from a pure psychology background, this was invigorating in some ways, but mostly stressful because of the poor quality of the course material. This culminated in the unit everyone was most excited for - an introduction to machine learning. The course was run by someone who would eventually become a Very Important Person within the faculty, and boy oh boy, do I have some &lt;em&gt;questions&lt;/em&gt; about how that happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin with, The Great Lecturer, The Swaying Professor Whose Papers All Read Death, opened the introductory lecture with a certain amount of charisma. I remember laughing and thinking "Hey, this guy's all right!". Oh, how I laughed and laughed, unaware of the horror that he was going to visit upon me for the next 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he does something which has stuck with me ever since. There are so many ways of looking at it. It was a little pebble before the avalanche, it was the chink in his armor, and &lt;em&gt;everywhere I go&lt;/em&gt; I look for this event, because I know that I must find it then decide if I am running from the crushing snow or slaying Smaugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He displays about 200 lines of codes, invites us to run it when we leave the lecture, and upon arriving home I realize that &lt;em&gt;it can't possibly run&lt;/em&gt;. There is a hardcoded zero-division error, which means &lt;em&gt;he wrote 200 lines of code then just assumed it would work&lt;/em&gt;. I don't know how the rest of you work, but I assume that I have &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; introduced some sort of terrible bug into my code unless I test it every five lines. And frankly, when the tests pass, I become &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; nervous because it might mean my tests are bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I reflect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would I &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; show code to hundreds of students without testing out the ol' VSCode&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; run button? ... No, I really don't think so. The only way that would happen would be if I was in a rush and made one last edit which I thought was safe... but I'd never divide a number by zero like a fucking &lt;em&gt;dork&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's my working hypothesis? Maybe he's actually great, for I am a lowly dweeb with minimal work experience, and he is a professor. But I also remembered the charisma and thought "Hey! Maybe this guy shouldn't have the job he has."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I file this away, and some arachnid part of my brain hunkers down in wait for six months, a hundred multifaceted eyes glimmering with malice and, most importantly, a burning desire to &lt;em&gt;know the truth&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii"&gt;II.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, months later, the opportunity arises to find out if he could really be &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; incompetent. As every university seems to do, there is a group assignment, presumably to improve our collaboration skills. There are so, so many layers to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I suspect that almost everyone reading this blog will have the experience of being the person in the group that does all the work at university. I ran an ad-hoc poll at a party filled with my friends the other day, and I realized they were &lt;em&gt;all that person&lt;/em&gt;. University tasks aren't actually complex enough at most places to warrant division of labor, and eventually you get tired of trying to wrangle people who are still working out things like "starting assignments before the day they're due" and "doing their own laundry". We've all been there, I've been there, everyone is absolved of their sins but &lt;em&gt;I'm just going to go finish the work&lt;/em&gt;, okay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the university insists that this is actually preparation to the workplace, because you've simply got to collaborate and get the work done, or there will be consequences. If you are a student with a sense of justice, it is at this point that you have probably become incensed as you've actually noticed the lack of consequences for the slackers. If you complain, you will receive either nothing &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; if you're a real persistent jerk about it, they will bribe you by assuring you a minimum of a pass&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; as long as you report on progress regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, it turns out this is all actually &lt;em&gt;brilliant&lt;/em&gt; because that's &lt;em&gt;exactly what the real world is like&lt;/em&gt;. A handful of assignments (read: good teams) where everyone's effort actually matters, but it's &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; sort of just blundering around until everyone limps past the finish line, declares mission accomplished, then all the savvy people leave before they must reap what they have sown. If only people had comforted me by saying this was an accurate simulation of most organizations instead of telling me it would be better after I left! Think of all the pain that could have been averted!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do the universities &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; do it? Probably because they only have to pay tutors to mark ten teams instead of forty students, honestly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, The Great Lecturer, Whose H-Index Crushes Third World Nations, decides that it would be &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; if the final assignment is a machine learning competition. Graded on a bell curve. With no marketing criteria other than "How accurate was your answer?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the blissfully unaware of the whole machine learning space, here is a one sentence explanation which will allow you to understand this story, and is also probably one of the lowest-bullshit definitions available on the internet in 2024. Ready? Braced? Okay:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A human being goes through some records and categorizes them, then a computer looks at those categorized records and uses nerd math to figure out if it can approximate the rules the human was using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phew, that was a lot. You're a thought leader now, congratulations on your ascension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have an assignment where I'm given a big pile of categorized records, a big pile of &lt;em&gt;un&lt;/em&gt;categorized records, and told "the top four teams of the sixty-four teams enrolled will score a High Distinction". I don't know how it works in American universities, but maybe that's called an A+, yeehaw&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This is an extremely stupid assignment for many reasons, but I will leave figuring out the issues as an exercise to the reader, and instead merely kick off the brainstorming with "Do you think having to jealously guard your work fosters a learning environment which sparks joy?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assignment is here. The zero-division error is floating around my brain. I must score as highly as possible. We must do two things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One: We do what we always do after studying for years - I tell my team I'm going to do the whole assignment. They turned out later to be actually competent but I had learned not to waste time betting on this for an assignment where one person is the optimal team size anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two: We must defeat The Great Lecturer, The Academic Whose Citations Span The Sky As A Million Screaming Stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii"&gt;III.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I begin work with one thought blazing at the forefront of my mind, and without it I would not have found what I did. That thought was this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely a man that fails to run his code before taking it to a lecture is careless everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dataset we have been provided is strange. It is hundreds of thousands of records that look like this, with the categories having been masked by the staff with alphabetical codes (A - Z):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Record&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Category&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;C&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;C&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;C&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;C&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the text itself is stranger still. Even trying to guess what the link is between some randomly sampled A-categorized stuff, I come up with nothing. It all reads like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new type of mosquito has been discovered in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is in the same category as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a special day in the Mayan calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What on &lt;em&gt;earth&lt;/em&gt; is the link between these things? Remember, the goal of the assignment is to get our computers to learn some rules connecting the text to the categories, then running that rule against a dataset that looks thus: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Record&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Category&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any team that figures out what the rule is, while they can't just label the records by hand, &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be able to manually verify their algorithm's correctness and gain a huge advantage over the competition. Most people don't even try, but the savvier students at least &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; to cheat a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, The Great Lecturer, Whose Weighty Soul Is Borne Aloft By A Cacophony Of Weeping Doctoral Candidates, has assured us that he has gone to great lengths to find this data set, and that we will be unable to figure out where it is coming from. A preliminary Google search reveals this to be true. Everyone gives up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from me, because I remember his zero-division error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grab a record and run an &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; search, meaning that I wrapped the text in quotation marks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv"&gt;IV.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jackpot, you bastard. I've cracked your puzzle, you sick fuck, and no God can save you from me now that I know you are &lt;em&gt;weak&lt;/em&gt;. They're some sort of weird articles posted on BBC webpages, which I now suspect were generated from an RSS feed. I note that there's a tiny label saying &lt;code&gt;china&lt;/code&gt; at the bottom of the page. I do some checking and &lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt;, he has somehow scraped a million of these, and the labels at the bottom are what the categories are. The reason that mosquito discovery and the Mayan calendar are both labelled as China is... low-quality data entry at the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we aren't even &lt;em&gt;getting started&lt;/em&gt;. Remember, I &lt;em&gt;broke&lt;/em&gt; the competition, I didn't just score slightly higher than the other nerds, who were also presumably on track to become some of Australia's leading data science practitioners&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My arachnid-mind is triumphant, and thinks "If someone is going to be this silly... no. He wouldn't have. But yes, he &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, there is one major issue with simply looking up all the records in what we call the "test" data set - the one that I need to label and get graded on. It's &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; and I'd have to repeatedly run searches to try dig up the records that I'm looking for. It's unachievable, but if it was achievable then I'd just have all the answers. Unless...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow me to draw your attention to something. Recall the dataset looks like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Record&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Category&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;C&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;C&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;C&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;C&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the As, then all the Bs, then all the Cs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if The Great Lecturer, Whose Heart Is A Cannibal Inferno Burning Taxpayer Money, &lt;em&gt;didn't shuffle the test data&lt;/em&gt;? Because if that was the case, then I could take this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Record&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Category&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And select a record in the middle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Record&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Category&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then select another record in the middle of that split:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Record&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Category&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then repeat that process between A and B until I find the &lt;em&gt;exact spot&lt;/em&gt; where A becomes B&lt;sup id="fnref:7"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. By finding the boundary between A and B, then the boundary between B and C, I can just assume &lt;em&gt;everything between those points&lt;/em&gt; is B with a number of comparisons that I'm too lazy to work out or look up, but it would have a pleasingly large value in the denominator, or maybe a &lt;code&gt;log&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;√&lt;/code&gt; somewhere else. You know, one of the happy complexity symbols, not the sad ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v"&gt;V.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am right. No one has ever been more right, and I am not open to arguments to the contrary. Please leave them in the Complaints box, yes, the one next to the raging bonfire and paper ash. By the next day, I have achieved a perfect score on the assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the thing that we all expected to happen in the real world happens. In a good book, I would have been given an amazing grade for my slick work, but this wasn't a book. The university states that this exploit isn't allowed as a submission. The superficial reason is that it doesn't demonstrate any understanding of machine learning, but the real reason is that it's embarrassing. I would probably go extremely far out of my way to hire a student that did the same thing (but of course I'd say that, having done it). But a more concrete, less masturbatory data point is that one of my team members, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterince/"&gt;Peter Ince&lt;/a&gt; - who actually had industry experience, offered to help me find employment. Peter is in the crypto space so I never took him up on this&lt;sup id="fnref:8"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt;, the person that was actually employed on real engineering projects was impressed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I'm left in a slightly awkward position. Between fencing training, my other assignments, and messing around with this, I don't have a good solution prepared for the assignment. I was smart enough to know this was going to happen, but I just &lt;em&gt;had to know&lt;/em&gt; if I my read was right on The Great Lecturer, Whose P-Hacking Rends Reality Asunder, being clueless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miraculously, things get stupider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a few days left, the first thing I do is ensure that I have &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; solution that performs adequately, as the bell curve means that I can instantly guarantee myself a pass since I know that most of the teams are probably just starting anyway. One of our lecturers had spoken about Amazon's &lt;a href="https://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/index.html"&gt;H2O&lt;/a&gt; platform, which does AutoML (read: you put the data in and it just kinda tries stuff until something works). So I start by using H2O and save that solution, which takes ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I Google similar problem domains, and perform some &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; work, setting up some simple training stuff to run on my laptop overnight using &lt;a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"&gt;XGBoost&lt;/a&gt;. I put a lot of work into this as I'd sure &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; a high grade, if only so that my Southeast Asian surgeon dad is not embarrassed to have produced such a mediocre son, but the solution feels lackluster at the end. It was really just churning through tons of different options in XGBoost, and there simply didn't seem to be any obvious improvements to try. Years later, with &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; work experience and knowledge, I still have no idea what else would really be worth trying, as most of the problem probably does degenerate into a complex word search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I submit to grading and score 4th with the XGBoost solution, being approximately 0.025% off from the 1st place score! High Distinction! Let's go! Astute machine learning specialists will notice that, doing the assignment fairly, your grade is almost certainly determined by variance during the model building process rather than effort, which is probably also a metaphor for life outside of university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait. What was the 5th place score? It was &lt;em&gt;still lower&lt;/em&gt; than what I got from just pushing everything into H2O and clicking run? What the &lt;em&gt;fuck&lt;/em&gt; were all the other students doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="AI_ROI.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/41083912.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are we not seeing return-on-investment because AI is hard, or is it because of those sixty-four teams, only &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt; of them rolled out an answer better than using the lowest effort solution in the world as a benchmark and those are the only people that are worth hiring? Or is it, perhaps, because The Great Lecturer, Whose Hideous Forms Belies His Extensive Cross-Disciplinary Research, has a counterpart, The Great Executive, Whose Rolex Clicks Through Gears Of Human Suffering? We may never know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="intermezzo"&gt;Intermezzo:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my first programming class (may I remind you, at the postgraduate level) I arrive to find that the lecture hall, normally packed, sits half-vacant, almost a third of my peers missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first assignment was to write a Python script that takes a user's name and age from the terminal and print it. A full third of the students plagiarized because they were unable to figure out how to run a variation of &lt;code&gt;print(input("What is your name?"))&lt;/code&gt;, but they made the tactical error of being in noted gigachad lecturer &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gavin-kroeger-39ba6a216/"&gt;Gavin Kroeger's&lt;/a&gt; class, Whose Luminous Being Suffuses My IDE, so they all got suspended instead of a rap on the knuckles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also all still graduated eventually, somehow, so please never, &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; feel bad for not having a degree. I think they might &lt;em&gt;increase the odds that a randomly given person is incompetent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vi"&gt;VI.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Great Lecturer, Whose Forked Tongue Tastes The Air Of LinkedIn, runs another unit on data wrangling, which is such a spectacular disaster that the final assignment stretches two weeks into the exam period because students keep discovering new issues that make the assignment &lt;em&gt;literally impossible&lt;/em&gt;. It took some of the students over six months to recover from the sheer stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I am in a room with his head tutor, who remarks that thanks to another issue with the assignment, I &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; score 75%, but am only allowed to score a maximum of 50% because The Great Lecturer, Whose Tweets About Research Impact Arrive In Satan's Ear, decided that scoring less than 50% on the flawed part of the assignment removes &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; your marks from the second part. Almost every student had crashed in at 49% for technical reasons I can't even remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other students have sadly accepted their low grades - many of them were caught out on the same error, but we do not accept that authority figures can make mistakes here (also a useful life lesson). The head tutor is having this conversation with the entire cohort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I am Malaysian, and I have a least a passing understanding of dealing with morally compromised midwits via cultural osmosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remark that I am extremely distressed that I have to raise such a formal complaint with the dean, or possibly the ombudsman, over one mark. However, if my grades &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; 75%, then I would probably be happy, and it's just &lt;em&gt;one mark&lt;/em&gt;. If &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; we could decide that the subjectively graded parts of my assignment were worth &lt;em&gt;one mark&lt;/em&gt; more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He nods cautiously, changes my grade on the first section from 49% to 50%, gives me a total grade of 75%, and we never speak of the matter again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; funny thing about this is that there was a point in my life where I thought grades mattered outside of applying for courses with academic gatekeepers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vii-reflections"&gt;VII. Reflections&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the experience, I wish I had been more open to the idea that &lt;em&gt;much of my work experience&lt;/em&gt; would consist of people not taking things terribly seriously - which is not even incompatible with having fun. I could have learned a lot from university and spared myself &lt;em&gt;a lot of pain&lt;/em&gt;, instead of learning some things the hard way. It's true that university is &lt;em&gt;unusually&lt;/em&gt; silly in most domains, but in many ways the exaggeration of the worst traits in large, impersonal organizations (no accountability, many authority figures, those lowest in the rungs lacking perspective, only having remediation mechanisms where authority judges itself) would have prepared me for things like my eventual navigation of the immigration machinery in a way that my young, inexperienced brain could have actually processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, many of the lessons from my university experience stem not from lecture material, but from simply paying attention to what I struggled with and what others struggled with (and similarly watching to see what people &lt;em&gt;didn't&lt;/em&gt; struggle with and copying them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take my psychology studies. The smartest psychologists I know, such as Melbourne University's &lt;a href="https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/74935-charles-malpas"&gt;Charles Malpas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:9"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:9"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; were absolute machines, but the majority of practitioners were very lackluster, with even PhD students frequently demonstrating that they lacked any serious foundation in statistics, epistemology, and scientific thinking. The &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; value and test of a psychology qualification is whether you can discern the bullshit from the useful material, and weaponize that against the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychology degrees are obsessed with two thousand word essays. When I tutored, I would always instruct my students to seek feedback from their tutors, and specifically ask "What would I need to do in order to score 80%? It is very important to me."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt; of the matter is that because the majority of psychological research is silly&lt;sup id="fnref:10"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; the type that goes into undergraduate courses, you're really being marked on writing ability, which is actually vibes-based if you want to score higher than 65%. For some reason, many students believe the fiction that their grades are based on some merit intrinsic to the writing, but once you have passed the basic hurdles of formatting and grammar, the difference between 75% and 90% is style and, in the case of mediocre lecturers, pandering to their biases. If I started grading random fiction models on from 0% to 100% and insisting that various reviewers would consistently land within even 5% of each other, you would call me insane. If I do this for student essays, now I'm just a normal tutor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the advice my students got was nonsense. Anything from "paragraphs should be less than a hundred words" to "why are your paragraphs shorter than a hundred words?". The &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; reason that you always ask tutors for advice is because you are trying to make them have to overcome &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance"&gt;cognitive dissonance&lt;/a&gt; if they want to grade you lower than the amount you were aiming for. At the very least, how could a student do &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; after seeking advice? What would that say about the advice giver? Heck, this would &lt;em&gt;work on me&lt;/em&gt; and I'm the main distributor of this trick! The course is actually filled with material saying "Humans are great at coming up with post-hoc justifications for things", and the real test is to see if you're &lt;em&gt;clever enough to act on that information&lt;/em&gt; even if the people setting the test don't realize that's what it's about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that calculating and possibly awful? Yes, but people were paying me for &lt;em&gt;grades&lt;/em&gt;. Trade offer: You give me money. I give you an unfair advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I'd advise them to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Actually&lt;/em&gt; used &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition"&gt;spaced repetition&lt;/a&gt; for studying, because the Australian system is based on multiple choice questions and this is probably &lt;em&gt;objectively&lt;/em&gt; the fastest way to rack up infinite points in those formats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave all social media groups with other students, because they tend to experience massive &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink"&gt;groupthink&lt;/a&gt; and produce homogenous work, then wonder why they all only got 65%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finish their work two weeks before it was due or I wouldn't look at it, so they'd stop suffering from perpetual &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law"&gt;Parkinson's Law&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My overwhelming experience both during and after university has been that many people &lt;em&gt;struggle&lt;/em&gt; to do very basic things, in a way that is perplexing and interesting in equal parts. I've said it before and I'll say it again, the reason I keep piano playing in my life is that I am &lt;em&gt;profoundly untalented&lt;/em&gt; at it, and I refine my playing approximately as stupidly as The Great Lecturer, Whose Grants Are Unrealized Cancer Cures, produces his lecture material. Painfully stumbling across the keys every week in front of my clearly-perplexed teacher&lt;sup id="fnref:11"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:11"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; helps keep me grounded even as I occasionally accomplish something that might otherwise go to my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also brings to mind the simple joy of being a recalcitrant malcontent who doesn't take kindly to undeserved authority, which is not the best self-promotion but probably honest. There's something healthy about &lt;em&gt;seeing clearly&lt;/em&gt; and trusting your intuition over social scripts, at least sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Morpheus &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdy8bFiyzY"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come on! Stop trying to hit me and &lt;strong&gt;hit me!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or Yoda comes out with the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4yd2W50No"&gt;classic&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try not. Do or do not. There is no try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we briefly put aside that the authorial intent was probably to say something that sounds profound but is actually silly&lt;sup id="fnref:12"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:12"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, there are many &lt;em&gt;symbolic&lt;/em&gt; ways to tackle problems, such as &lt;em&gt;studying very hard&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;talking about how tech debt prevents systemic improvement&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;juggling Jira cards&lt;/em&gt; which are completely unrelated to solving the actual problems. I think that's what causes people to have this inkling that there's something there, even if they forget by the time the movie is over. Symbolic efforts are frequently a failure of imagination, a failure of genuine attention, or to simply have a woe-is-me story when things go wrong - and I've done all three at different points in my life, absolutely. Seeing clearly is a joyous and enriching skill, and is incidentally the part of the LessWrong/Rationalist movement that I like, when all the weirdness is excised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of it all, the great lessons I took were that you can usually tell if you're trying by looking at whether you're &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; doing what the struggling masses are doing, that everyone is going to be clueless in a few areas of their life (hopefully not the ones they charge society huge amounts of money for), and most entertainingly, that &lt;em&gt;incompetence is widely exploitable for fun and profit&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I wish all of that veil-piercing somehow waived those enormous university fees&lt;sup id="fnref:13"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:13"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I was probably using Pycharm because universities really don't seem to teach the important things - I don't know &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; that uses Pycharm in the data space.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've only seen this once, and in retrospect it should have been a valuable life lesson.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn:7"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This long-winded explanation was because I don't write much on technical things, and we have several non-technical readers with us. However, I thought it was interesting that this only came to me because I had recently skimmed &lt;a href="https://use-the-index-luke.com/"&gt;Use The Index, Luke!&lt;/a&gt; which was my first introduction to binary search algorithms. Weird how almost everything ends up being useful!&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:7" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, he is the only person in the space that I respect enough to bother wondering whether there's some tiny sane pocket in there.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:8" title="Jump back to footnote 8 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:9"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who will be no doubt thrilled to see that one of his highest profile students, who credits him as a statistics mentor, mentions him in an article referring to good time complexity as having "happy symbols".&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:9" title="Jump back to footnote 9 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:10"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably most research in every field, honestly. My Honours and Masters theses were complicated and stressful, but even &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; don't believe in the results.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:10" title="Jump back to footnote 10 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I will note that a &lt;em&gt;common&lt;/em&gt; error with new sabre fencers it that they will &lt;em&gt;attack your blade instead of you&lt;/em&gt; because they think that's what fencing is! You can stand totally immobile and they will frequently bounce off your guard anyway.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:12" title="Jump back to footnote 12 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/breaking-my-universitys-machine-learning-competition/</guid></item><item><title>Most Tech Jobs Are Jokes And I Am Not Laughing</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/most-tech-jobs-are-jokes-and-i-am-not-laughing/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It is a cold Anzac day in Melbourne, and I am &lt;em&gt;brooding&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've followed through on my commitment to interview in the tech industry without relying entirely on in-network referrals as I normally do (for a good reason - my network consists largely of the most competent people at mediocre companies!). It is dystopian out there. These are some anecdotes on my interviewing experience, the treatment you get as a job-seeker, and some serious reflections on whether I should just... well, outright leave the tech industry, despite the many conveniences that it affords me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i"&gt;I.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Read ad.  Send in resume.  Go to job interview.  Receive offer.”&lt;/strong&gt; is the exception, not the typical case, for getting employment: Most jobs are never available publicly, just like most worthwhile candidates are not available publicly. - &lt;a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/"&gt;Patrick McKenzie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have lived and breathed this advice since graduating, and it is the reason that I was allowed to stay in Australia while most of my peers were sent back to the extremely painful material conditions of their home countries. Nonetheless, now that I have permanent residency, I decided about two months ago that it was time to move on from working at the average company, the sad land where standup lasts an hour, management has the technical acumen of my 92-year old grandfather, someone will one day institute a compulsory return to office, and the kitchen tea is from the cheapest supplier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, the tea in the office kitchen is disgusting to a degree that offends me. This isn't tea, it's hot leaf juice! If I'm going to be a human resource, can we at least concede that I'm an &lt;em&gt;expensive&lt;/em&gt; human resource and warrant the extra A$5 for a real brand? It's got an aftertaste that I can only describe as "essence of licking batteries". I used to bring my own tea into the office in a little ziplock bag, but now I &lt;em&gt;insist&lt;/em&gt; on imbibing their liquid hatred. Whenever someone asks me whether we have a good office culture, I take another sip from my mug of acid and say "I've noticed some substantial issues with management's behaviour" even as the scorching tide of face-scrunching bile ravages my taste buds. The tea is an eternal reminder of the gap between where I am, comfortable though it may be, and my fully realized potential. The tea causes me to radiate an aura that makes the thought leaders I know slightly uneasy around me. But I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has become exceedingly clear to me that the average company is not a suitable environment for someone that cares about the craft of programming. To make things worse, once your standards are &lt;em&gt;high&lt;/em&gt; for yourself, I'm guessing that only the top 1% of companies in terms of workplace culture is not a personal offense. The only options laid out before me are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have my own business be successful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a top 1% company in terms of engineering culture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave the technology space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, my business is bootstrapped and will take a long time to take off, so I guess I'm looking at #2. And for the record, I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; take the idea of leaving the technology sector very seriously. There is much to commend it in terms of laziness, but I'm interested in doing good work with a solid team where I'm not treated like a recalcitrant toddler (where or not I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; a recalcitrant toddler is very much still up for debate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, against my own better judgement, I decided to look for a job the &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; way for the first time in my life. You see, the problem is that although I know many genuinely smart people, they &lt;em&gt;all work at bad companies&lt;/em&gt; because I started at a bad company. There's a serious network effect in play, where I found work at an incompetent organization out of university, and my network has since spread itself to other incompetent organizations. Because they're smart, they've tended to float to lead or director roles... but the organizations themselves are still pathological. It looks like, and I am loathe to admit this, I might need to &lt;em&gt;engage with the job market&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep my goal in mind for the rest of this post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to work with &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; people who are good at their jobs, affirming to spend time with, the company doesn't waste hours of my time on meetings or placating dysfunctional leadership, and the product should be one that I think that contributes meaningfully in non-trace amounts. I'm willing to take a title &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a pay cut (and expect to do so when working with people who are hopefully going to be teaching me how to do this whole thing better).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that's a high standard, but is it too high? I dunno, stay in your fuckin' lane, pal. I moved to Australia &lt;em&gt;explicitly so that I could be privileged&lt;/em&gt;, why would I stop at the amount I have now despite being grateful overall? For the inevitable person that gets upset that I haven't settled for less, I invite them to try painting themselves brown and working in Malaysia to simulate my early career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; more serious concerns. People often say that you should not seek all that fulfillment from work, but I've tried enough to know that I need at least &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; from work. I wouldn't be happy with anything less, at least until I've got kids and have bigger concerns, but that means being unhappy with work is probably the expected outcome. And to top it all off, I have the very serious constraint of wanting the work to benefit society unambiguously - and it is obvious that the strongest engineering culture in Melbourne exists at cryptocurrency companies, which I refuse to work for on principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, there's no point complaining without trying, so I brushed up my CV, immediately interviewed at a few places, and was absolutely horrified at &lt;em&gt;what people are putting up with&lt;/em&gt;. This industry is &lt;em&gt;fucking absurd&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-getting-interviews"&gt;II. Getting Interviews&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tech industry is fundamentally unserious about how it recruits, hires, and retains candidates. About which I have a lot more to say than could fit in a tweet, but, a good thing to know. - &lt;a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/936615043126370306.html"&gt;Patrick McKenzie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I landed two interviews with about forty minutes of work, and the way I did this was absolutely horrible. You see, I had always believed that submitting a CV was some sort of stupid joke. People just vaguely skim them at best, and usually it's clear during an interview that no one actually took the time to read the damn thing. I assume the filtering is being done by someone in HR that doesn't understand the field, or possibly a recruiter that doesn't understand the field. While I have &lt;em&gt;occasionally&lt;/em&gt; lobbed a few conventional applications over the fence, I've never received an interview. Up until now, I always found a job through my network before this became relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My unsuccessful CVs talked a lot about my contributions to the company. The typical advice is to ensure that lots of quantifiable data appears on a CV - "I increased revenue by 26% by running A/B tests". My CV looked pretty good on this front, with &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-accidentally-saved-half-a-million-dollars/"&gt;"Reduced Snowflake expenditure by A$500,000"&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/flexible-schemas-are-the-mindkiller/"&gt;"Salvaged A$1.2M machine learning platform"&lt;/a&gt;. Yeah, it turns out that no one cares. Under a model of the world where my CV was being filtered on by people that don't understand anything about quality, we test out a new strategy, baked up in-house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I scrubbed all the personality out of my CV and wrote the word "Snowflake" as many times as possible. If I was facing homelessness, I'd probably lie and write the word "React" as many times as possible and be employed in two days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That alone got me two interviews immediately, in a market where people have assured me that it's next-to-impossible to get employed. You've got to work on your &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/does-a-software-engineer-have-scorpion-nature/"&gt;frog-turned-scorpion&lt;/a&gt; disguise, folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should I be surprised that I was unhappy with the quality of those interviews? No, of course not. Do I think they're &lt;em&gt;entirely representative of the market&lt;/em&gt;? Yes, they &lt;em&gt;obviously are&lt;/em&gt;. The CV-based market for &lt;em&gt;serious people&lt;/em&gt; outside of FAANG is almost entirely fictional as far as I can tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-interview-one"&gt;III. Interview One&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seriously interviewed or been interested in four jobs in the last year that didn't come from my own network. Every single one of them, &lt;em&gt;even the ones that I was picky about&lt;/em&gt;, were absolute fucking jokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year ago, I interviewed at a company which deals in small loans, located right here in Melbourne. It's supposed to be quite serious, which huge revenues and a very fancy office. The recruiter (a guy I quite like) informed that they were looking for an excellent candidate who would really elevate the business to the next level in the data engineering space. I'm informed the interview is not technical, just a "getting to know you" conversation, but that professionalism is extremely important - I should be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; careful to wear a white shirt and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enter the call, and am greeted by some guy with absolutely atrocious social skills. Within two minutes, he starts reading off questions about Databricks, eyes clearly scanning a Word document. After fielding the first few questions, I realize that he's... not stopping. We're averaging about a question per minute, until he stops to complain that my video and audio quality is making it hard to hear me (a connectivity issue that was almost certainly on his end). He says we'll continue the interview tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I leave, confused. But I turn up the next day anyway, against my better judgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;em&gt;he does that shit again&lt;/em&gt;. We don't continue the interview, he &lt;em&gt;asks me the same questions&lt;/em&gt;, in retrospect probably off a ChatGPT-generated list, and he's got a &lt;em&gt;buddy&lt;/em&gt; this time. They &lt;em&gt;both take turns&lt;/em&gt; asking questions off the Word document. At the end of the interview, they ask me if I have any questions, and I fairly bluntly ask them what they're looking for in a candidate, as they hadn't indicated any interest in social or business skills. I usually ask employers what areas of the business they were struggling with, and these guys said "We have no problems" despite all evidence to the contrary. I finally snap and ask "I was told this role was for a senior who could help elevate for the practice. To avoid wasting anyone's time and to be clear, are you looking for that or for someone to just help click buttons?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They &lt;em&gt;don't even have the decency to be offended by my rudeness&lt;/em&gt; and reply with "Oh, we're just looking for someone to click buttons."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recruiter calls me the next day to inform me that my question prompted them to close the role, and re-open a new one at the junior level because they only needed a ClickOps monkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They &lt;em&gt;took my advice&lt;/em&gt;? They &lt;em&gt;didn't realize that they just needed a nerd to push buttons&lt;/em&gt;? Like, what the &lt;em&gt;fuck&lt;/em&gt; is going on over there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-interview-two"&gt;IV. Interview Two&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second interview was a result of the previous interview, demonstrating that it is impossible to escape the power of human relationships. The same recruiter saw my name pop up on Seek, and sought me out for a role which involved setting up all the data engineering and machine learning capability at an organization entering the scale-up phase. I had only worked at mature companies, so this had a few things going for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a small organization, maybe it wouldn't be all red-tape&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm probably one of the few candidates in Melbourne who can make a &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; attempt at building out both data engineering &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; machine learning capability from scratch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It probably pays well with all those requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh boy, was I wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did to prepare for the interview was investigate the company. Their product is essentially just the software that lets people reserve desks at an office, and they had a few clients already. They were actually a subsidiary of a much larger company that had access to plenty of clients, so they were mostly facing a sales problem. However, during the course of this sleuthing, a few strange things pop up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few other strange things pop up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered that the CEO of the subsidiary... was the son of the &lt;em&gt;parent&lt;/em&gt; company's CEO. Which does not &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; mean there are some serious issues with the business - after all, perhaps he learned at the feet of a business genius from the ripe age of twelve - but let's be realistic, that's concerning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of their engineering staff have &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; visible on their GitHub accounts - not even a project that they got two lines into and then threw away, which I honestly accept as a sign of baseline competence these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I hop into the interview and discover that the salary for a role described as the CTO's right-hand man, involving two sophisticated domains is... basically exactly what I earn now, doing &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of those jobs in a non-leadership context. The interviewer, the CTO, argues with me saying that it's &lt;em&gt;totally reasonable&lt;/em&gt; for one person to get all that work done inside of a few months despite the fact that &lt;em&gt;entire teams&lt;/em&gt; of actually competent people would consider success in six months to be respectable, stating that "if you're smart and motivated, you can get amazing things accomplished", which is true but also keep those words out of your filthy mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked what AI features they had in mind... they had none. When I asked if AI would actually drive any sales (their real leverage was the parent company's sales team being deeply involved in office construction, not AI features) they said... they didn't know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pour on a little bit of charisma and secure a second round interview (and a higher salary). And despite the fact that I am basically certain that the job was mine, I was so disgusted by the treatment that I declined. Get outta here with that "we need a chatbot built" nonsense. You just &lt;code&gt;import openai&lt;/code&gt;, get someone else to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we finish up, I offer to send them a different candidate who would be interested, and he asks me to cut the recruiter out of the process. A recruiter who previously described this guy as "extremely emotionally intelligent" and "a good guy". Cool, cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are the two jobs that I &lt;em&gt;was hand-picked for&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v-interview-three"&gt;V. Interview Three&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrive for an interview with an international consultancy, and within thirty seconds realize that their in-house recruiter billed me as some sort of Azure specialist despite the fact that the word does not appear on my CV anymore - remember, I removed everything except the word Snowflake, and begrudgingly had one mention of AWS. They seem actually competent (though the work seemed like more of the "present yourself as a cog in some vast, soulless machinery" stuff I already get) and we parted on good terms once we realized something had gone terribly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vi-interview-four"&gt;VI. Interview Four&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interview four hasn't happened yet, and I've inferred that it probably never will, but even the application process was offensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A medium-sized organization in the psychology space was recently hiring for an AI lead here in Melbourne. This is something that I'm uniquely suited for, since I'm someone that has &lt;em&gt;applied for their clinical training&lt;/em&gt;, is pretty well-qualified in the psychology space, has an AI background, and am otherwise the most competent technician that they're likely to see given their domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, it's obvious that they're confused, but that only makes me &lt;em&gt;more eager&lt;/em&gt; to help them out because I really care about the mental healthcare space. They want an "AI and Automation" lead specifically, looking for someone that has extensive experience with machine learning &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; PowerApps, two things that have basically no overlap. The former is a domain so broad as for that requirement to be useless, and the latter is a strong indicator in industry that your team doesn't know how to engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's obvious that they don't even know how to filter for candidates, so I call their front desk to get ahold of the person that's listed on the job application, and then it all gets weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, they've never heard of the job, which is weird because the organization isn't that big, but nonetheless the lovely person who picked up the phone gave me the email address of the hiring manager. Oh, did I not mention that the hiring manager didn't leave contact details? We have a chat, and at least the person at the front desk liked talking to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After writing an email to the hiring manager (who hasn't replied yet), I realize that there's &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; email address way at the bottom, and it says enquiries should be directed to them. I send one more, very heartfelt, email. It includes sentences like "This is something &lt;em&gt;I really care about&lt;/em&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They immediately respond with this &lt;em&gt;even though I have been explicitly instructed to send all my communications to them&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please direct all follow ups or applications for the position to hr@redacted.org.au&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being told to talk to HR at a place this disorganized is &lt;em&gt;barely&lt;/em&gt; better than being told to go fuck myself, without the benefit of being forthright. It was at this point that I stopped bothering to look for jobs on the open market. It's probably for the best, because I should have known better than to &lt;em&gt;voluntarily sign up&lt;/em&gt; to try and institute organizational change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vii-is-the-tech-market-small"&gt;VII. Is The Tech Market Small?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a given that the tech industry is large - very, very large. I can't even begin to guess at how many jobs there are available for people who can make computers do things for a living. But something that I'm starting to very sincerely believe, and I don't know how it could be otherwise, is that the &lt;em&gt;number of jobs for serious people is probably very, very small&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, if you have the goal I stated above...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to work with &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; people who are good at their jobs, affirming to spend time with, and the company doesn't waste hours of my time on meetings or placating dysfunctional leadership. I'm willing to take a title &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a pay cut (and expect to do so when working with people who are hopefully going to be teaching me how to do this whole thing better).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...then the market in Melbourne, a city with over five million people in it, might &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; be between five and fifty roles &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; roles. That could be off by two orders of magnitude, but it's clear that most roles that meet my criteria, even dropping the "meaningful product" requirement, are simply unavailable at most points in time, &lt;em&gt;especially if you're on the open job market&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most competent engineers I know (of the variety that want to work be on fulfilling teams, not use their power to try and transform dysfunctional teams into good ones) do not even flinch when I say something like "It feels as if 95% of engineering teams are cosplaying as being whatever we imagine real engineers to be". That, for the most part, seems to be obviously true if you work at the bajillion companies that aren't sexy enough to produce thought leadership. This explains things like why I've seen teams at major employers that store &amp;lt;4 kB of logs a day in fucking DynamoDB - they just read that this is what people do and want to do the cosplay better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is not to say that &lt;em&gt;it is impossible to find good work&lt;/em&gt;, just that while the job market is large, the &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; job market is tiny. I wouldn't be surprised if finding a genuinely fulfilling job has about the same hit rate as starting a bootstrapped business from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I talk to people that worked at Pivotal Software&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, while some of them agree that things weren't perfect at the company, they all largely seem to be dreaming of one day finding an organization that is even &lt;em&gt;remotely as good&lt;/em&gt;. It's very much like watching a bunch of dwarves in the immediate aftermath of Smaugh/VMWare, roaming the lands and plying their incredible trade, but secretly only wishing that they could go back to their mountain stronghold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not anonymous anymore, so I can probably just outright name the best work culture I've seen and they have to deal with the fallout of being associated with me. This is what Taleb calls symmetry. Reader &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-walkenhorst?originalSubdomain=au"&gt;Matt Walkenhorst&lt;/a&gt; reached out to me last year to introduce me to &lt;a href="https://www.flip.com.au/"&gt;Flip&lt;/a&gt;. They are the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; team I've seen that doesn't make me want to set my head on fire. No one even knows they even exist. They've invited me to their office several times, and everyone seems to &lt;em&gt;actually enjoy being there&lt;/em&gt;. Half the staff have the sort of demented keyboards that I know I'd barely be able to type on, at least one of them uses Emacs as their IDE, and they all talk about how happy they are to have &lt;em&gt;finally found somewhere that doesn't suck&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I briefly met their CTO, Keith, over lunch with the team, and was really impressed by how normal he was. I won't quote anything spicy, but suffice it to say that the management there has strong opinions on how nonsensically the rest of the industry runs. I unfortunately didn't talk to Keith that much because it seemed &lt;em&gt;extremely cringeworthy&lt;/em&gt; to immediately devote all my attention to the most well-titled person in the room, so the conversation was mostly Emacs focused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="viii-should-i-leave-the-tech-industry"&gt;VIII. Should I Leave The Tech Industry?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the understanding that my standards for employment are &lt;em&gt;extremely high&lt;/em&gt;, something I'm grappling with now is that it doesn't make any sense to stick around at mediocre organizations, and &lt;em&gt;they are almost all mediocre if you unbrainwash yourself out of accepting the low bar&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My business only benefits from my conventional employment if I take the time to climb the ladder, which is a political exercise that I'm &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good at, but being good at it comes with an understanding of how disgusting it all is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I set my standard to "at least as good as Flip", there's really no reason to stick around my typical employers because &lt;em&gt;they aren't making me competitive for those roles&lt;/em&gt;. The only way to do that is self-study, because at my normal jobs I'm just slapping people on the knuckles and saying "just use Postgres, you bastards", and then they use DynamoDB anyway the moment I look away. One day, one of those people will finally clue into this blog and I want them to know that I &lt;em&gt;do not forgive them&lt;/em&gt; for storing our ETL logs in DynamoDB. Please retire to do something that doesn't hurt my soul this badly and that you might actually have an aptitude for, like burning down orphanages or kicking puppies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, shouldn't I just do something else &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; for my day-to-day expenses while I wait for Flip to open up a role? What's the point in pretending that the place that was &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-accidentally-saved-half-a-million-dollars/"&gt;wasting half a million dollars on their cloud spend&lt;/a&gt; is going to teach me anything? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are all sorts of wonderful benefits to working at incompetent companies that have at least &lt;em&gt;parts&lt;/em&gt; of their culture in order, such as not doing backbreaking labour and not getting screamed at by an angry Australian construction manager, but I still can't shake the feeling that I owe myself something better than "I've found a company where I can zone out of meetings to cook a healthy lunch", particularly with the Australian winter coming around, where I must once again face the reality of the sun being gone by the time I clock out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I must ask myself questions such as &lt;em&gt;where do I go&lt;/em&gt;? What would I do instead? I've earned money without depending on a company before (which everyone should try) which drastically changes one's relationship with it, but the truth is that Melbourne is very expensive. Back to clinical psychology? I'm suspicious of any plan that starts with "I pay the university system a lot of money and then my problems will be solved". Here's a relevant snippet from an obscure &lt;a href="http://909sickle.net/s/the-facts-of-life"&gt;webcomic I discovered as a kid&lt;/a&gt; that was highly formative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="popstrip.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/cfb5095d.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Become an electrician like a friend that just quit engineering? Carpentry? Automobile repair? Write a fantasy novel? Start a cult? Back to privately tutoring statistics? There are thousands of ways to make a living, that all come with different upsides and downsides, some much more fun and much less wise than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I live a strange dual-life, where most of the people I talk to know about my strong opinions, and basically know what my energy is. I'm anti-productivity cult, I like craftsmanship, I love tabletop RPGs and reading, I adore Terry Pratchett, so on, so forth. You can guess a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; about me from my writing. It filters for people that I love talking to. All my consultancy's advisors and our lawyer are readers, because I really have &lt;em&gt;no reason&lt;/em&gt; to work with anyone else. Even Flip is a company I'm only aware of because of my writing. There are many, many people that I speak to these days, and I am perhaps too lavish in expending my time, but it is hard, when you can speak to another human with an open heart, to get &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I turn up to yet another interview, and see another interviewer struggle to even treat me like a real person, I am the soot-stained dwarf, longing for my lost homeland. Are they behaving rationally? I don't actually care, I just want nothing to do with it. And no, I don't have ten years of Azure experience you fucking bastard, &lt;em&gt;just skim my CV&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now though, I think I'm done looking for a new job outside of my network, whatever that means. I suspect my new standard for a job might be &lt;em&gt;work with a reader&lt;/em&gt;, and I'm going to look at totally different fields in the meantime. At the very least, it'll be an interesting life experience. This is something I am seriously mulling over, and any advice is welcome. Reach out with alternative fields if you left tech, jobs if you're happy at work, or with general thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ix"&gt;IX.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes people remark on my blog and say something was &lt;em&gt;depressing&lt;/em&gt;, and it usually surprises me what people find depressing. It is &lt;em&gt;invariably&lt;/em&gt; the stuff that I don't find depressing at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone is reading everything I just wrote and thinking "That's depressing". There's nothing depressing there - why does it matter if most I.T jobs are cosplaying at real engineering? Are you cursed to not dream of better for yourself? Will you die the moment you stop calling yourself a software engineer? In 2024, it's not hard to do something different. Just work on yourself, treat people well, and be authentic. It'll take some time, but that's okay. It took me years of slogging to leave Malaysia for Australia, and it &lt;em&gt;sucked&lt;/em&gt;, but it was also fine. The struggle builds character, though between us I &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; have preferred not struggling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been reading &lt;em&gt;The Hero With A Thousand Faces&lt;/em&gt;, which I picked up after learning that George Lucas was inspired to write Star Wars after reading it. You might also find it interesting to note that Lucas decided to get into film after surviving a car crash that resulted in this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="lucas.jpeg" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/71ac8243.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Star Trek's Gene Rodenberry survived three plane crashes, which resulted in the deaths of many other passengers. I'm just going ahead and extrapolating that I should be bolder &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; risking the near-death experiences. You aren't supposed to leave steady jobs, you aren't supposed to work three days a week instead of buying a house, and you aren't supposed to critique your employers. Were those the smartest things I've ever done? &lt;em&gt;Obviously yes, it just keeps paying off to be myself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the book is about the power of story in the human psyche. I'd like to leave with a few quotes from the foreword by Clarissa Estés:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an ancient story called "The Conference of the Birds," a flock
of a thousand birds, during a time of great upheaval and dark
ness, suddenly glimpse an image of wholeness—an illumined
feather. They thusly feel encouraged to take a long and arduous
journey to find out what amazing bird this illumined feather be
longs to.&lt;br&gt;
...&lt;br&gt;
There are some birds who also wander off the path and those who flee it. The birds are, in essence, questing for the fiery phoenix, that which can rise from its own ashes back up into illumined wholeness again. In the beginning, the thousand birds set out to enter into and pass through seven valleys, each one presenting different barriers and difficult challenges. T h e thousand birds endure increasingly hostile conditions, terrible hardships, and torments—including horrifying visions, lacerating doubts, nagging regrets. They long to turn back. They are filled with despair and exhaustion. The creatures receive no satisfaction, nor rest, nor reward for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, more and more of the birds make excuses to give up. The attrition rate continues, until there are only thirty birds left to continue this harsh flight that they all had begun with such earnest hearts—all in quest for the essence of Truth and Whole ness in life—and, beyond that, for that which can light the dark again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, the thirty birds realize that their perseverance, sacrifice, and faithfulness to the path—is the lighted feather, that this same illumined feather lives in each one's determination, each one's fitful activity toward the divine. The one who will light the world again—is deep inside each creature. That fabled lighted feather's counterpart lies ever hidden in each bird's heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the story, a pun is revealed. It is that Si-Morgh means thirty birds. The number thirty is considered that which makes up a full cycle, as in thirty days to the month, during which the moon moves from a darkened to a lit crescent, to full open, to ultimate maturity, and thence continues on. The point is that the cycle of seeing, seeking, falling, dying, being reborn into new sight, has now been completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her poem, entitled "The Daemon," refers to the angel that each person on earth is believed to be born with, the one who guides the life and destiny of that child on earth. In the piece, she questions this greater soulful force about going forward in life. The daemon answers her quintessential question with the ancient answer:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said, "Why not?"&lt;br&gt;
It said, "Once more."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These responsories are an echo from twenty-one hundred years ago, when the venerable first-century-BCE rabbi, Hillel, encouraged in his mishnah, "If not now, when?" This simple and powerful encouragement to go on with the journey has been expressed in different words, at different times, to the yearning but timid, to the uncertain, the jaded, the hesitant, the dawdlers, the postponers, the fakers, the foolish, and the wise. Thus, since the beginning of time, humanity has lurched, walked, crawled, dragged, and danced itself forward toward the fullest life with
soul possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others, including the Persian poet-priest Kabir, tell instructive stories through poetry using themes like this: First thing in not too much to say that an abundance of compelling and unpredictable heroic stories can re-enspirit and awaken a drowsing psyche and culture, filling both with much-needed vitality and novel vision. From the ancient storytellers to the present, the idea has always been: As go the souls that lead, so goes the culture. In the morning, do not rush off to work, but take down your musical instrument and play it. Then test your work in the same way. If there is no music in it, then set it aside, and go find what has music in it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose that's all for now. As I mentioned, I'm still on the lookout to work with readers, and I don't terribly care if it's even paid so long as it's a fun team or with an open source project, so please reach out. In the meantime, I'm going to be thinking about what to do while I wait for work that has music in it, sending an application in to Flip for the heck of it, spending the day with my partner, and, most importantly, making some &lt;em&gt;non-corporate&lt;/em&gt; tea.&lt;/p&gt;

It took me six months to regain the ability to do anything beyond resting the moment I was done working, and in the past year I have recovered much of my ability to function, though not necessarily in the sense of spending eight hours in an office - that is forever gone. Instead, I find myself producing all sorts of things that I never had the time, energy, or spark for when I was spending thirty minutes commuting to the city, crammed shoulder-to-shoulder with the rest of the populace, a further eight hours in the hideous lighting of an open-plan office, and closing out with a final thirty minutes commuting back home. This is the life lived by most knowledge workers, and it was one where people sometimes openly envied me for, after a few months of acclimatizing, having the energy to go to the gym consistently after work. And, just between the internet and me, I was leaving the office a half-hour early without permission, three times a week, so that the squat rack wouldn't be totally occupied or I wouldn't have even been getting &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was living for the weekend, watching the clock 'till closing time, and otherwise embodying "Happy Friday!" energy, a phrase that still absolutely rocks me with the juxtaposition of good-natured cheerfulness and the dystopian acknowledgement &lt;em&gt;we'd all rather be doing something else&lt;/em&gt;. This was a period of my life where I was earning more money than I knew what to do with, being both single and without dependents, but once the rush of wealth wore off, it stopped meaning a whole lot to me. Not imagining anything better was possible, I was actually quite happy about it for a while after leaving university - putting aside the time it took to realize that most people were just pretending to work for five of the eight hours of the day, and to become numb to all that vacant-eyed screen-staring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I'm (mostly) out, I'm starting to realize, with some intense dismay, exactly how much I was giving up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i-meaning-from-work"&gt;I. Meaning From Work&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since largely escaping the office, my "work" has been very different. In that time, &lt;a href="https://www.hermit-tech.com/"&gt;I've created a (barely non-zero revenue) business with some of my closest friends&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/the-controlled-detonation-of-my-anonymity/"&gt;de-anonymized myself despite using language that will stress my very conservative father out when he finally reads this blog&lt;/a&gt;, caused a &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39558376"&gt;stir&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39628696"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38402515"&gt;Hackernews&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34955309"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37806870"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38069710"&gt;times&lt;/a&gt;, and started a &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/does-a-frog-have-scorpion-nature/id1737204926"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;. Some of this is a real accomplishment, some of this isn't&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and the jury is still out on a fair whack of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the character of the work itself is very, very different. For one thing, I am earning A$90K less per year (i.e, losing that money in opportunity cost) because I refused to take a five-day-a-week gig last year, and currently receive only about A$1.7K a year for my writing, but I &lt;em&gt;value that little bit of money so much more&lt;/em&gt;. It just about pays for all my music classes being forty-five minutes instead of thirty minutes, and I &lt;em&gt;savour&lt;/em&gt; every second of them because I feel like I've earned them producing something that brings people joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, there are all sorts of stark differences. When I went to an office, I'd have days where I'd drag myself out of bed and wish I could get &lt;em&gt;just a little more sleep in&lt;/em&gt;, but the neighbor's dog woke me up at 5AM. &lt;em&gt;Now&lt;/em&gt; I wake up and think, "Well, I'd love to sleep a bit more, but I get to make a cup of tea and enjoy working in that beautiful moment before the world is fully awake." I frequently force myself &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to roll out of bed and start writing within a minute of waking up in a desperate bid to maintain some semblance of not being a Ritalin-addled Silicon Valley "thought leader". This is a relationship with labour that I never expected to experience, and it really is wonderful. I make some exceptions for the painful parts of the business (read: grinding out leads) which frankly &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; aren't nearly as bad parsing yet another spreadsheet while wishing that you had one of the desks next to a window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People talk a lot about the joy they get from stakeholders and customers telling them their product was useful. Not only have I rarely experienced this in a believable way, a fair few of the people who espouse happiness about this strike me as having brainwashed themselves into valuing very strange things. A great deal of small work has real value and I don't wish to denigrate that, but there are clearly flavours of work that are more meaningful to most people than others. I always think of HR - I didn't have a single peer at university whose fondest wish was to spend eight hours a day harassing strangers to complete useless mandatory training, but we find ourselves here anyway. More concretely, many people in my specialty (data) end up talking about how appreciative their internal users are with visual upgrades to a dashboard which is opened a few times a month. Sure, I'm glad someone feels good about that. But surely that's inferior to someone in data entry saying that the new UI reduces their toil, and &lt;em&gt;that's&lt;/em&gt; inferior to optimization algorithms increasing patient flow at a hospital. The mania in the eyes of the corporate-bred when they discuss "prettier dashboard" with the same zeal as "literally saved lives" scares me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read a book called &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Focus-SECOND-Achieving-Objectives-ebook/dp/B0939T8ZS8/ref=sr_1_7?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=Christina+Wodtke&amp;amp;qid=1620355397&amp;amp;sr=8-7"&gt;Radical Focus&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago, which was fine. I learned some useful things. But it has this bizarre tendency for the protagonists, who have a company working on the supply chain of tea to retailers, keep saying the company is &lt;em&gt;changing the world&lt;/em&gt;, something that is &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; true and might resonate for some true tea aficionados (and Godspeed to them). But if we're being honest, if this was said in real-life, probably by someone that calls themselves an entrepreneur, it would usually indicate that your interlocutor has been captured by an ideology best described as "wanting more VC money"... which as I say, I realize is their main concern in the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can just admit that some stuff is meaningful, but, with all things being equal, most of us can &lt;em&gt;trivially&lt;/em&gt; imagine something that would be more meaningful to us, were it not for the pesky problem of earning a living and corporations being pathological.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my first job, I had to get used to the awkward energy of having people &lt;em&gt;lie&lt;/em&gt; to me about my work being useful because they didn't know I could see they never opened it, and most data initiatives are useless to customers because they're managed so badly. Someone, somewhere, had to write that LinkedIn feature that tries to automatically generate spam responses to posts &lt;em&gt;on their own platform&lt;/em&gt;, a feature that I &lt;em&gt;desperately&lt;/em&gt; wish that I could have been in the discussions for just to see what on earth is happening over there, and I can assure you with total certainty that a fucking moron tried to tell the engineers involved that the work was meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="linkedin-autospam.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/944d96c4.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are we fucking &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; as a society? I am also reminded of Netflix chad Primagen telling the story of &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/s-vJcOfrvi0?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=368"&gt;how he spent a year of his life getting Black Mirror to display S4:E1 to users on their homepages instead of S1:E1&lt;/a&gt;, a "feature" that was mostly perceived as a bug to the best of my knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must contrast that with opening my inbox and seeing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've even committed some of the business' time (as have my co-founders) to assisting &lt;a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/tina-lam"&gt;Tina Lam's&lt;/a&gt; research into combating alcoholism, whose team can't possibly afford the rates that professional software engineers charge &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; Tina sent me this gorgeous watercolor painting of my pet rabbit apropos of nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="rabbit_watercolor.jpeg" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/efa29e01.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the face of these gestures of appreciation, it is difficult to contemplate what I might have given up had I worked in slightly-less-toxic-but-still-toxic workplaces. Like a &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/does-a-software-engineer-have-scorpion-nature/"&gt;frog being boiled&lt;/a&gt; I would have just kept slogging away, never quite experiencing enough discomfort to arrange something better for myself. I may have my own doubts, like most people, about the value of what I put out, but I won't be so rude as to deny that &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; people value it or that it brings me happiness to see it valued. What a terrible deal it all was in retrospect. For A$90K, give up an international network of friends, a chance at owning your own business, your health, and your energy! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-intellectual-growth"&gt;II. Intellectual Growth&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, I've found myself reasoning a little bit more deftly with each passing week. That's the only way I can think of to describe it - I've been connecting thoughts in disparate fields that have surprised myself, been speaking more fluently, and otherwise felt switched-on in a way that I haven't for a long, long time. A friend of many years stopped me to ask if I'm okay, and when I asked why, he said I &lt;em&gt;sounded smarter&lt;/em&gt;. Despite this, as someone chronically arrogant in my late teens, I was concerned that I was getting high on my own supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, on a whim, I popped open my old Master's thesis code. It's a deeply flawed piece of work for various reasons, ranging from my own inadequacies as a young engineer to my truly accursed university-bred workflow, but it looks &lt;em&gt;astonishingly&lt;/em&gt; complex to me, to the degree that both the code and the actual text of the thesis look like they were written by someone ten times smarter than me. I dimly recall checking out a physical copy of Mardia and Jupp's &lt;a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Directional+Statistics-p-9780471953333"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Directional Statistics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which does appear in the citations of the paper, but was there &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; a point in 2019 where, instead of blearily reading over the &lt;code&gt;pandas&lt;/code&gt; documentation  to deliver a report no one is going to read, I was so concerned with how to write an expectation-maximization algorithm from scratch to estimate the parameters of mixed von Mises distributions that I &lt;em&gt;checked out a physical book&lt;/em&gt;? That sounds like some fucking nonsense they'd say in Star Trek right before explaining why the warp core is about to overload for the tenth time that season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it clicked. The feeling of suddenly feeling smart was &lt;em&gt;just reclaiming the intellectual life that the corporate world demanded I sacrifice&lt;/em&gt;. I used to spend huge numbers of hours reading, to the point that my poor, despairing parents used to tell me off for developing a strange left-handed claw-grip that I would use to manipulate books during meals, and I kept reading all the way through university. The fact that I was giving this up never occurred to me because "you'll be too tired to read something complex" isn't in the contract I signed with my first employer, it's just sort of baked into the fabric of the universe at all but the greatest workplaces. Reading slowly dropped off until it wasn't happening at all, not even for something useful! Just to stare at a screen then go home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn't glance over at a book during office hours, because non-engineers (and bad engineers) think it looks bad when I stopped staring at my computer screen while I was in the office, and even audiobooks prevented me from readily pausing and pondering whatever I was listening to. The train was too packed at 8:30 AM in Melbourne to have enough space to turn pages without borderline fondling my fellow passengers. I had to stop engaging with a wide range of topics that were too nuanced or controversial to be suitable for office discussion, such as whether the institution should come out in support of same-sex marriage or whether the green crayons taste better. I was lucky enough to get home by 5:30 PM, which left me just enough time to be done with the gym, showered, and fed by 7PM if I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hustled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there are scarcely any other arrangements available within the normal social script, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; due to my visa situation at the time. But even excluding that constraint, the industry has congregated on some strange norms where they default to a 9AM to 5PM workday, and can't tell which engineers are productive so we mostly have a few productive people subsidizing others that are scared of version control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am university education's greatest nemesis - I think having a degree that wasn't obtained for visa reasons makes many candidates &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; appealing. What &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; good is that I had sixteen hours a day free to indulge my curiosity (because I was studying psychology which, even as someone who is deeply invested in the field, I must concede is basically a pseudoscience at the level it is taught in undergraduate courses). I did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; spend this time very wisely - I am always reminded of Scott Galloway repeatedly admitting that he spent his time at university &lt;a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/hunger/"&gt;smoking pot and watching Planet of the Apes over and over&lt;/a&gt;. I wasted about 80% of my time, but the remaining 20% ended up being incredibly formative simply because I had &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting from my first year, I drilled hundreds of hours of sabre fencing, which is a simple but fascinating exercise in game theory, complete with &lt;a href="https://sydneysabre.com/2023/01/26/week-10-the-tactical-wheel/"&gt;rock-paper-scissors style tactical wheels&lt;/a&gt;. In fencing, I watched and participated in my own rivalries that drove people to the absolute peaks of their personal performance - mine wasn't that high but it was higher than I thought - and watched other people wash out because they didn't have the discipline for training. I even watched my old club fall apart as one or two of the strongest veterans left, which tells you a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; about how excellence works in most places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After one of my philosophical units, I read &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_Ethics"&gt;Practical Ethics&lt;/a&gt; in its entirety simply because the university insisted I buy the whole book to read a few chapters. Around this time, I came across Taleb's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Swan:_The_Impact_of_the_Highly_Improbable"&gt;The Black Swan&lt;/a&gt; and as many other books as I could stomach. I had enough time to watch probably every talk from Christopher Hitchens that's available on YouTube (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DP8nrMG3Zlk"&gt;what a fucking champion&lt;/a&gt;) multiple times, and regardless of what you think of him, the man could &lt;em&gt;talk&lt;/em&gt; and the man could &lt;em&gt;write&lt;/em&gt;. I did so many things that I probably can't even remember 95% of them, ranging from getting far too invested in running a good tabletop game to trying out 5AM Muay Thai classes&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I moved on to my Masters in Data Science (also a borderline fraudulent degree - they cancelled Data Structures &amp;amp; Algorithms because none of the students were taking it) and fumbled around with some Python, before finally writing what felt like the insurmountable challenge of my thesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, my education distracted me from my learning&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but I persevered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I graduated, got my first A$100,000 salary and... did... nothing. I mean, I &lt;em&gt;worked&lt;/em&gt;, whatever that means, but it's strange what we teach students what the world is going to be like. You get through primary school, where they tell you to get your act together because high school will be the real deal. Then you go through high school, where they tell you to get your act together because university is the real deal. Then you go to &lt;em&gt;university&lt;/em&gt;, where you're told to get your act together because the workplace will be the real deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you go to the workplace where, at the &lt;em&gt;overwhelming&lt;/em&gt; majority of workplaces, it takes weeks to make a firewall change, and the three most important skills are how busy you can look, how close you are to being a confident-tall-white-cis-dude (only one of which you can change), and how good you are at telling the boss that they're awesome without being so clumsy as to sound like a sycophant. Other skills become more important as you defect from the system and play smarter games, but those are &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; the most important things for advancement in a large corporation, and I'm brown, outspoken, and of average height. A bit of a heads up that society, broadly speaking, doesn't want me advancing too far or rocking the boat would have been awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My problems turned from the sophisticated, mind-broadening concerns that my supervisors encouraged me to think about, such as how conceptualizing model fit in terms of &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-387-27656-4"&gt;information theory&lt;/a&gt; is a parsimonious framework for penalizing overly-complex theories, to the utterly dull, where dimwits asked me to use Excel to plot linear regressions because it's what they were familiar with, even if it made no sense. I no longer opened books, I read out-of-date Confluence pages to learn about acronyms for bespoke enterprise systems that I didn't care about. Soon, it had been over a year since I had truly had a &lt;em&gt;complex&lt;/em&gt; insight into any topic, and I was instead having all my energy deflected into meaningless issues such as "Why does the I.T department keep telling me I can have that VM I need, then scheduling another meeting saying it needs further review?" or "How do I convince people that say they do their learning on LinkedIn to give two fucks about my work?".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amidst this all was a barrage of people repeating platitudes that &lt;em&gt;sound&lt;/em&gt; people oriented but boil down to something toxic. "Complaining about these things shows that you aren't a mature engineer", which is really "You aren't a good software engineer if you think it's possible to drive value by writing good code instead of dealing with organizational dysfunction", or "This is just the reality of the industry" which translates to "Thinking that better work is possible is naive and immature", which does nothing other than drive people from the field or away from taking care of themselves, &lt;em&gt;and isn't even true&lt;/em&gt;. Yes, &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt; a person saying this stuff is guilty of all charges, but sometimes they're totally right that everyone should shut up and let them fix the problem. Only a Sith deals in absolutes, you scumbags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She reached down and picked a crab out of a bucket. As it came up it turned out that three more were hanging on to it. "A crab necklace?" giggled Juliet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Oh, that's crabs for you," said Verity, disentangling the ones who had hitched a ride. "thick as planks, the lot of them. That's why you can keep them in a bucket without a lid. Any that tries to get out gets pulled back. yes, as thick as planks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; core of this is the simple observation that life trends towards whatever you spend your time on, and I was being paid what was, in retrospect, &lt;em&gt;not enough&lt;/em&gt; to spend almost all my time structuring my life around things that, if they didn't impoverish me, enriched me at a &lt;em&gt;tiny&lt;/em&gt; fraction of what I could have been doing. I thought I was being paid to turn up at an office, but I was &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; being paid to no longer have the time or energy to seriously better myself. The deal makes sense until I have enough money to comfortably avoid homelessness, then each dollar gets less and less valuable, but &lt;em&gt;society only has a default template to buy most of us in five-day-a-week batches&lt;/em&gt; whether you like it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-corporate-topics-are-largely-dead-ends"&gt;III. Corporate Topics Are Largely Dead-Ends&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core of this is the simple fact that the topics at &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; (not all) workplaces are an endless labyrinth of growth-related dead-ends, almost all oriented at somehow convincing people to better themselves against their incentives. This seemed to me like a necessary ingredient to work, until I directly experienced that there is an &lt;em&gt;endless chasm&lt;/em&gt; between what this is in the best case and the average case. The &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; case is a collaboration where everyone learns a lot and leaves feeling respected, and once you've tasted it you can't go back. The &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; case is trying to incentivize someone to care when they've worked out that they don't need to learn anything new to continue drawing a salary. The way to personal development is fraught with diversions into trying to fix these fundamental issues that &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like they are going to lead you to a great deepening, but in practice are simply shallow nonsense for unserious people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one of the most extreme and somewhat sympathetic examples, consider the industry around Agile and Scrum, &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-will-fucking-haymaker-you-if-you-mention-agile-again/"&gt;even though we all know this is something I hate doing&lt;/a&gt;. Whatever you think about the broad ideas around Agile originally, the thing that we actually have has become some putrid, shambling mound replete with a thousand salivating mouths, all asking why you haven't cleared more tickets this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shambling mound is an object which deserves hatred, but consider the individuals that constitute that mound. Most of us have direct experience with the fact that there are people that &lt;em&gt;sincerely&lt;/em&gt; will spend the rest of their careers shuffling Jira cards around a board, never realizing that a Story point is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; supposed to be a unit of time, and they will nonetheless spend &lt;em&gt;most of their professional lives&lt;/em&gt; thinking and stressing about this. They will lose sleep, they'll have their mental health atrophy, they will cheer when they accidentally load up a sprint with easy tasks and mistake the velocity for something they did right, and otherwise engage in a career that consists of nothing more than Agile-flavoured astrology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, they &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; they're being paid to help a product ship features, but are in fact committing themselves to decades of an impoverished intellectual life. It is all, fundamentally, nonsense, and I find it profoundly sad when I see this. Half of me wants to shake people and say "My God! You don't have to live like this!", and the other half wants to gently reassure them that scoping tasks down to the hour, as pointless an activity as exists, was worth all the misery they endured. Most of us end up being deflected from the things that are most authentic to us into matters that merely &lt;em&gt;sound&lt;/em&gt; like they aligned with our goals, though perhaps less visibly than the people who have never read the &lt;em&gt;literal four lines&lt;/em&gt; of the Agile manifesto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first flavours of this that I fell for was the trite adage of trying to "educate my stakeholders" into making more reasonable requests from data teams. Is it possible to help a non-specialist understand how to best make use of your talents? Yes, and it's a huge part of the job description, even now as a consultant. &lt;em&gt;Can&lt;/em&gt; you educate everyone that has no interest in learning and no general competence? &lt;em&gt;Of course not&lt;/em&gt;, that's why everyone says the hardest part of consulting is finding good clients. The fact that people will happily say that you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; and acknowledge that the hardest part of consulting is finding good clients shows that they aren't thinking clearly, because those are more-or-less mutually exclusive lines of thought. The fiction that you're somehow going to accomplish a harmonious working environment without the ability to tell someone to fuck off is only propagated in corporate environments. The moment you have to earn money yourself and surround yourself with people on the same journey, it evaporates in its entirety. There are &lt;em&gt;many, many&lt;/em&gt; people that I don't want to work with, that I don't want to "educate", whose narcissism, short-sightedness, and all-around disrespect are &lt;em&gt;someone else's&lt;/em&gt; problem because I value my health. But when I was spending all my time at a normal corporate gig, it was my problem, and most teams are &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; bad hire away from entering such a dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first client that approached my consultancy had a website outage which was costing them approximately A$1.4K per day, at a rough estimate. When I cited a bill of A$5K to fix the (simple) issue and then ensure that it never happens again, they immediately came back with some fairly insulting questions about how the work could possibly be worth that much for "changing a few lines" (at which point I declined the work), similarly insulted the cheaper overseas contractor I forwarded them on to, and eventually spent &lt;em&gt;two weeks&lt;/em&gt; finding someone to fix the issue on Fiverr. Then they went &lt;em&gt;back to that contractor&lt;/em&gt; to tell them how they got the problem solved for A$50 &lt;em&gt;after losing two weeks of revenue&lt;/em&gt;. They took the time to reach out &lt;em&gt;just to insult someone that was trying to help&lt;/em&gt;. That all sounds comical except &lt;em&gt;that fucker still runs a company&lt;/em&gt; and some poor bastard is out there having to deal with that sort of treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also once watched a woman working in data science, at the request of someone that gets on stages in Melbourne as a thought leader and executive, produce a ten page document explaining the concept of artificial intelligence and what it was capable of doing. She worked on it for several days, delighted that someone had finally demonstrated an interest in actually doing the whole machine learning thing correctly, instead of just asking for more spreadsheets. The executive, &lt;em&gt;who asked for it&lt;/em&gt;, said that the ten minutes it would take to read was "too long" then asked her to produce a spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that it's always the ground staff's fault for failing to play psychotherapist to the disrespectful people is something &lt;em&gt;you can waste years on&lt;/em&gt;. You can, of course, develop as a person at a company by the simple virtue of living your life and talking to people, but it is hardly an &lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; way to do so, at least in typical engineering roles. I've still only seen &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; (small) business that wasn't subject to this sort of borderline-psychologically-violent personality, and it happens to be our main client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with them is such a Zen experience that I can feel my blood pressure dropping just thinking about it. The last time I visited, we talked at length about what would serve the business best strategically, got diverted into a conversation about how mermaid.js-driven documentation is delightful, hammered out an action plan, then got lunch with the whole team. Then they paid me my highest hourly rate ever &lt;em&gt;voluntarily&lt;/em&gt; because they didn't need us to do the work ourselves but wanted us to feel valued. And for the purposes of this article, &lt;em&gt;neither of us wasted any time trying to handle the other party like toddlers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many, many downsides to not working a comfortable office job. I mentioned to a recruiter that I sometimes contemplated whether it was healthy for me to spend so many hours in an office. He replied that he used to be a plumber, and that he would regale me with tales of working at 5:30AM in the freezing mud if I ever wanted to bail. I believed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the first day I had off from work was a Thursday. I went down into the Melbourne city center with a book, and ended up lying down in a park with a book, in beautiful weather. Glancing over, I realized I could see the office that I would have been working from a few weeks ago, where I wouldn't even have been able to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; the park because I didn't have a window seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever a company tells me they have more than one mandated day in the office (even I'll concede that socializing a little bit might make sense), I tell them to piss off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rich Hickey has a wonderful talk titled &lt;em&gt;Hammock Driven Development&lt;/em&gt;, on what it takes to do high-quality work. The man, to the best of my understanding, more-or-less made Clojure, which means we take his talks very seriously here. It is a ponderous piece on how &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; deep work is produced by some strange interaction between loading your mind with important information and then basically lounging in peace. I've had my own experience with this, having solved most of the hardest problems I've ever worked on in the shower the next morning, and sometimes I've seen the &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; side of this. During the Covid lockdowns, I had to stop playing chess because I would wake up exhausted from trying to solve unsolvable tactical puzzles in my sleep. I'm not saying this was making me better at chess, I'm just saying the unconscious mind is doing some &lt;em&gt;truly weird stuff&lt;/em&gt; and we'd be foolish to pretend we know exactly what, and I'd rather &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; load it with garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me about thirty seconds to punch 'Hammock Driven Development' into Kagi&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, knowing with absolute certainty that I'd find something to illustrate my point. I immediately landed on the following &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29413382"&gt;quote on Hackernews from a delightful fellow named Felix Dahlke&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminds me of how I solved some of the hardest problems I've ever worked on (all in side projects) while being on parental leave, pushing around strollers. During that time I had something of 1-2 hours at the keyboard each day, but endless hours to think. It was quite the enlightening experience, I was literally shocked how much I got done as opposed to exploring problems while writing code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I've never managed to find that kind of focus at work, neither as developer nor CTO, neither remote nor on site. I feel I've always spent a large chunk of my time trying to get people to explain the problem they're trying to solve, to stop rushing, or to reduce scope. Tragic, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that I am a lot more productive, even in crude, capitalist, give-shareholders-a-return-on-investment terms, when I am free to idly work at a sensible pace. In fact, this is why I am a software engineer instead of doing brutal manual labour - because working on a domain where a leisurely stroll can translate into immense value is a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; way to live in a system that is focused on value extraction. When I fill my days with meetings around whether the Change Approval Board (CAB) is going to give us the go-ahead for a project where &lt;em&gt;they literally don't know what we're talking about&lt;/em&gt;, my thoughts are now filled with the CAB. Is this necessary for the functioning of a large organization? I have my doubts, but I'm willing to accept that for now. Is this what I want my subconscious to be working on? &lt;em&gt;Fuck&lt;/em&gt; no, and I don't get control over this if I have to sit through four hours of meetings on it. Even when I did my best to embrace the old "work-life balance" schtick, clocking out at 5PM sharp, my subconscious was still worrying away at soulless, uninteresting problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I spend a lot of time reiterating is that one of the key things that you pay a large class of professionals for is their &lt;em&gt;judgement&lt;/em&gt;. You can pay for other things, such as their muscles if you're moving to a new house and want movers, but even in that case you're paying for experienced-driven judgements such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Judging what orientation would be the most effective in getting that couch through this door&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working out how many people it would take to semi-safely move this cupboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of software engineers, you're paying a lot for &lt;em&gt;design&lt;/em&gt; intuition, and that is only partially solved by paying someone to sit in front of a screen and demand they think about a particular topic. I currently have extremely clear career savings of &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-accidentally-saved-half-a-million-dollars/"&gt;A$500K&lt;/a&gt; and ambiguous savings&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/flexible-schemas-are-the-mindkiller/"&gt;A$1.2M&lt;/a&gt;, with literally everything else I've worked on for an employer having been a total and complete waste of everyone's time. I really, really think, removing that first year or so where I made my most egregious blunders, that I could have been producing something like A$200K in surplus per year measured in nothing other than mistake-avoidance and workflow improvements (excluding the non-repeatable events of finding lots of "save hundreds of thousands of dollars" buttons), had I been free to actually both think without constantly having to justify that the job will take as long as it'll take. God knows what that number could actually be if I actually shipped products instead of slapping people's hands every time they reach for Lambda functions because they heard serverless is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(But that's another dead-end: wasting endless time trying to convince people at larger businesses that one's role should be fundamentally different, or that the organization can be made competent. Not a single person out of the hundreds of emails I've gotten have provided an example of someone transforming their job this way, but it is also a myth that persists. Every success story involved either &lt;em&gt;starting one's own business&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;going somewhere good that someone else started&lt;/em&gt;. A reader recently ran into the legendary Kent Beck at a book signing. On the topic of improving the median organization, Beck said that all he ever got out of it was stress-driven eczema. I am neither smarter nor more experienced than Kent Beck.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a somewhat painful topic to think about for me, because while there are many things that I'm happy to sacrifice, my intellectual development isn't one of them, though I may sing a different tune if I find myself feeding kids. I'd be a homeowner now if I had been okay continuing to put full-time hours into an office environment, and knowing that might never happen as the market grows beyond my savings is not easy. This is the reverse problem, where I'd almost prefer it if &lt;em&gt;having endless hours&lt;/em&gt; free to think deeply didn't change me as a person for the better... but how could it not be thus? Should we be surprised that studying mathematics makes one better at maths? Then I wouldn't have to answer hard questions about what this means for everyone in the workforce in general. Do we really have to choose growth or home ownership? Is it crazy to think we could have both?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had some job interviews which I really didn't enjoy recently, and I declined to proceed to the next stage despite receiving another decent offer. After the second interview, I caught Iain McLaren for lunch, the mysterious lawyer than nonetheless is a formidable programmer that I mentioned &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/leadership-is-a-hell-of-a-drug/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and said something to the effect of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm a bit worried that my standards are too high."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To which Iain replied, very quickly and in a manner which suggested he hears this a lot and never approves of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Go on, but I don't think there's such a thing."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are much worse starting points than that for taking care of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vi-taking-time-with-people-i-love-away"&gt;VI. Taking Time With People I Love Away&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Jeremy Jone's &lt;a href="https://bittersoutherner.com/feature/2023/obituary-for-a-quiet-life"&gt;beautiful essay&lt;/a&gt; about his grandfather's life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best time of his life was when his girls were little, Ray said as he neared the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many things are less-than-ideal about working from home in a tiny, tiny apartment, but I got to watch The Next Generation, Deep Space 9, and Voyager with my brother over the last three years with the extra time. One day, when we're no longer so close or one of us is gone, I can't imagine trading those moments away for any amount of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vii"&gt;VII.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're trying this new thing where I attempt to strike a hopeful note. It was &lt;em&gt;not hard&lt;/em&gt; to make the trades necessary to be where I am today (not wealthy but very free), and I'm certain that a more talented engineer than myself can pass the "take care of a family" threshold while still maintaining control over their time, with a little bit of daring and cunning, with cunning being the ultimate virtue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some weeks ago, I was talking to a psychologist about the painful conditions that practicing clinicians undergo when they enter a poorly-run practice, which as per &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law"&gt;Sturgeon's Law&lt;/a&gt; which all the high-performance professionals I meet endorse and the peanut gallery insists is a sign of immense arrogance (we might both make valid points), is most clinics. It is not unusual to have many extremely distressed clients back-to-back, and the only way out is typically to start a private practice after grinding out a few years of experience&lt;sup id="fnref:7"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I remarked that it seemed very scary to have to do such a thing, and even I, a probably-overconfident person, was only able to take a stab at it because I know my three days in the office effectively protects me from serious threats such as homelessness. The psychologist, a much wiser person than myself due to both age and exposure to suffering, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Of course, but in life you have to go and get the things that you want, and that takes vision and courage."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot to mull over, and a lot of it is best reserved for individuals, preferably with a lot more life experience than me. I'm just going to focus on enjoying the comfort that my tiny, rented apartment and lots of free time brings me. But I wish everyone lots of vision and courage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons that I always say we're not earning much money, to the distress of people that wisely want me to project staying power to clients, is that I really don't want to underhandedly jockey for clout. A low-revenue consultancy is &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; as impressive as running an unprofitable business on VC money - it's literally as failed as a business can get and should be embarrassing, despite the glamour society throws at such people.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, since my first post ever was #1, I still &lt;em&gt;genuinely&lt;/em&gt; have absolutely no idea if this hard or not, but I don't know who &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; know the answer to this question or if asking it would make me sound like a jerk.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my second class, someone demonstrated what a knee to the stomach &lt;em&gt;at extremely low intensity&lt;/em&gt; feels like as part of a conditioning exercise, and I decided that I'm a lover, not a fighter.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This group presentation teaches communication skills!", or more accurately, "We couldn't think of another assignment and this way we can pay someone to mark your work &lt;em&gt;during class&lt;/em&gt; which is already paid for, and the tutor can do four students at once!"&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've left the horror of Google for the blessed peace of Kagi already, right?&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:6"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project still hasn't shipped, but it would certainly be 100% dead without my intervention.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:6" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:7"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same vein, I certainly find myself wishing that I had gotten jaded around the age of 35, after a reasonable stint at Google, whereupon I could probably just make bank doing Kubernetes correctly for people. Alas, I was in the spreadsheet mines.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:7" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scorpion wants to sell some software but cannot code, so it asks a frog to write the application. The frog hesitates, afraid that the scorpion might start running Scrum, but the scorpion promises not to, pointing out that they would both be out of work if they interfered with the frog's programming. The frog considers this argument sensible and agrees to work for the scorpion. Midway through the project, the scorpion demands the frog write Confluence pages, drowning them both in paperwork. The dying frog asks the scorpion why it did this despite knowing the consequence, to which the scorpion replies: "I am sorry, but I couldn't resist the urge. It's my character."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frog is confused and angry, but most importantly, drowning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been grappling a troubling question, which I trust you'll appreciate that I didn't use as a clickbait title. It would have been a banger. Does learning anything about software development actually matter? I'm in the strange dual position of working as a software engineer for a few days a week, where it isn't obvious that it matters that much, and running a software consultancy... where it isn't obvious that it matters that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface, this sounds like a spectacularly stupid question. Of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; it matters. Software engineering is a craft, and more than that, it's a craft that creates a lot of value, both in monetary and real terms, across the world. This post has been broadcast across the world to arrive in your house or on your phone thanks to software development. It's something that I've enjoyed for a few years now, and I've learned some incredibly beautiful things about abstraction, thoughtfulness, and design from the practice. And to top it off, I've earned what can only be described as an exorbitant wage for someone whose first job in Malaysia paid a measly A$700 per month, and is now choosing to fly to Europe to see eight people for coffee. That is &lt;em&gt;expensive&lt;/em&gt; coffee. Getting better at writing software leads to salvation in the eyes of The God of Code, and to the material circumstances that result in everything else in life getting better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the standard story. But something that needs answering first is "Does it matter in regards to &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt;?", and things immediately become murky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will trivially concede that it matters insofar as we must appease Code God, lest They strikes us down with thunderous volleys of blue screens and obscure kernel bugs. Perfecting the craft brings the peace of a craft being perfected, which is no small thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about everything else that I might want around my craft? Is getting better at programming actually a meaningful way to earn more money for my precious pet rabbit, that he may sup upon the finest hay Australia has to offer? Or now that I've got the basics down, is that done by repeatedly starting leading projects with expensive enterprise platforms and then leaving for the next victim before you're held accountable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="PXL_20240329_220824213_exported_875_1712180527466~2.jpg" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/ca0963a6.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've said it before and I'll say it again. I would murder &lt;em&gt;everyone reading this&lt;/em&gt; in cold blood to protect a single precious strand of fur on his sweet head, and the only secret Patreon benefit is a painless end. Tricking someone into buying the death-pit that is Informatica is table stakes next to homicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I going to get more than a pathetic scrap of autonomy and respect by reading &lt;em&gt;Designing Data Intensive Applications&lt;/em&gt;, or am I actually just going to sit here praying that some dickhead in a suit doesn't decide that it's finally time to bring everyone back to the open-floor plan office? I will acknowledge that some teams will benefit immensely from being in the same room together, but if I am going to learn how LZ4 compression works then you need to give me a door so that I can think in peace, you ratfuck bastards. Plus most companies have cultures that I can only describe as beige, and there is nothing worth preserving in that corporate soup anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I published the &lt;a href="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/nik9125/episodes/I-Dont-Even-Have-Pizza-Budget-with-Kijana-Woodard-e2htimk"&gt;second episode&lt;/a&gt; of my podcast, with &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kijanawoodard/"&gt;Kijana Woodard&lt;/a&gt; as the guest. He recounts an incredible story about management telling everyone they have to work the weekend, but &lt;em&gt;management&lt;/em&gt; won't attend because they've got a family thing on. Do I want to live my life that way if I have a chance at something else? Hell, I can easily &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; management because I was born with the grifter gene, and I battle against it every day, like a man who was bitten by an unusually large dog last month and now mysteriously gets real worked up around the full moon. Am I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; okay being the person that says "The boss asked me to sell you all on a return to the office, and I'm going to need you in this Saturday too. Everyone, please, stop crying, it's unseemly and your kids aren't that great anyway"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, is being good at programming even strongly correlated with landing on a good team? I've been in touch with people around the world, at all sorts of companies, and I can tell you right now that &lt;em&gt;literally every team and company&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; change in management or acquisition away from becoming an absolute shitshow. To make things worse, I'm still not certain that programming talent isn't &lt;em&gt;negatively&lt;/em&gt; correlated with good treatment - it seems to select for a personality that is very easy to exploit. In my wildest dreams, I land a reasonable position and stay there for ten years, but this isn't in my power at all. It seems that I'd be overwhelmingly likely to spend the rest of my life leaping from company to company while the mysterious cocaine-and-supercar connoisseurs play the Game Of Mergers, where you win rich or you lose rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the framework of the corporation as experienced by Dietrich in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Developer-Hegemony-Erik-Dietrich/dp/0692866809"&gt;Developer Hegemony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;being good at programming&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an effective way to write good code even if that's &lt;em&gt;all you care about&lt;/em&gt;. Being an excellent programmer is good, but you aren't a carpenter creating a beautiful chair in the sacred temple of woodwork. At most organizations, a third of the room is interested in making a good chair, another third is hell-bent on removing three of the legs to look good on wood-savings with the intention of leaving for a bigger woodworking operation before the whole thing collapses, and the last third have never seen a chair but nonetheless insist on getting a turn with the hammer. Even if &lt;em&gt;all you want to do is craft beautiful code&lt;/em&gt;, it seems that the &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; important skill is to develop the antibodies requires to defend your craftsmanship. I can't do my job if some random guy gets to pick all my fellow carpenters despite the fact they aren't one themselves, and decides how long a chair "should" take to make as if the reality respects human opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the question hopefully makes a lot more sense. It is &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; not clear to me that software engineering excellence matters if you've got serious plans to live with some peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii"&gt;II.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A frog wants to start a business selling software, and looks around for a competitive advantage. The frog notices that every other businesses seems to be run by scorpions that are good at sales but not programming, and decides to compete on engineering quality. After a year of work, the frog's superior product is ignored in favour of a scorpion's terrible product, leaving the frog to starve to death. The dying frog asks the scorpion why this has happened, to which the scorpion replies: "lol, lmao".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scorpion stings the frog for good measure, and calls it a nerd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essentially a cliché that sales is the number one problem faced by most businesses. In fact, it's so common that even people that don't know anything about business will parrot this, so now it's some sort of necessary-but-insufficient condition for being taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes people say that "every business is a software business", and I have concluded that this is self-aggrandizing nonsense. My business isn't a carpentry business because we need chairs to do our job. I do not need chair specialists, I simply need to work out what the value proposition is of buying the most expensive chairs for the team is, and the only things allowing me avoid the moral hazard of trading off their long-term spinal health for my own wallet are my tenuous grasp of ethics and that I only have equal partners, so they're allowed to buy themselves whatever they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even many companies that &lt;em&gt;ostensibly&lt;/em&gt; specialize in software, such as enterprise development companies, &lt;em&gt;do not specialize in software&lt;/em&gt;. They specialize in enterprise sales, and simply need to produce software that does not collapse until &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the contracts are signed. Then they charge their clients for variations, which I can only describe as some absolute motherfucker behavior. There is value in the software being well-engineered, but you can extract most of that value by being able to ship one bug-laden feature every six months. It's the old 80/20 adage - you just need to be able to do work that isn't going to immediately explode, and I passed that standard approximately one year into my career. Most problems are solved by CRUD apps with some simple integrations, and they really aren't that hard to make "good enough", though it would take me a lifetime to make them &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first piece of software I used in a corporate setting was ResearchMaster, a piece of crystallized devil-hate so fucking foul that contracts in their system were allowed to end before they started, which I discovered when I ran a query on a subset of our data which yielded an average contract length of &lt;em&gt;negative twelve&lt;/em&gt; years. This is the competition. By the way, ResearchMaster, I hope your product is so unpopular that this blog becomes the first result when it gets looked up, you mendacious cockroaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All things being equal in terms of sales, better engineering is... well, better. But all things aren't equal, and that's why when I pop open the financial statements of a few publicly traded I.T companies (which is extremely enlightening), I see that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They mostly talk about the acquisition of large-scale contracts, or businesses they've acquired that come with more large-scale contracts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The majority of the important people at the company come from sales backgrounds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even presumably exemplary programmers such as the venerated Patrick McKenzie and Jason Cohen produce oodles of material on &lt;a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2013/04/24/marketing-for-people-who-would-rather-be-building-stuff/"&gt;sales&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.salesfornerds.io/episodes-1-2-jason-cohen/"&gt;and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/enterprise_sales"&gt;marketing&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, Patrick McKenzie has an article with early career advice for people titled &lt;a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/"&gt;Don't Call Yourself A Programmer, And Other Career Advice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; at that title. The only bit of advice that deserved making it into the title was &lt;em&gt;Don't Call Yourself A Programmer&lt;/em&gt;. That is how severe he thinks the tactical mistake of identifying yourself as a programmer is, certainly to clients, and I suspect &lt;em&gt;even to yourself&lt;/em&gt;. Do I want to be a salesperson? No, I want to relax and write code I enjoy, and I suppose I am free to do that as long as I'm &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; okay being informed that I must keep doing Scrum, even as I want to hurl myself out of a tenth story window every time stand-up rolls around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii"&gt;III.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A frog has worked extremely hard on some software to ensure the well-being of everyone in the company. However, a recession is approaching, and the scorpions in management must make the hard call on who has to leave the company. After extensive deliberation, the scorpions vote that the frog is expendable. The terrified frog asks a scorpion why this has happened, to which the scorpion replies: "The scorpions have run the numbers, and while we appreciate your valuable contributions to this family, we've concluded that only scorpions are vital in the current economy. Thanks for the code and documentation, moron."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, when I was first getting into programming, I watched a YouTube video (that I can no longer find) from the guy that runs &lt;a href="https://pythonprogramming.net/"&gt;pythonprogramming.net&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfzlCWGWYyIQ0aLC5w48gBQ"&gt;Sentdex&lt;/a&gt;. He was doing some sort of Ask Me Anything, and someone asked him why he works for himself when he could clearly go get a job paying ∞ at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He confirmed that he does get a lot of job offers from all sorts of high-profile places, so that was certainly in the cards. However, he recounted a story about his first job. The thrust of it was that he worked for a small restaurant. One day, with no warning, he received a letter in the mail saying that the restaurant had shut down, effective &lt;em&gt;tomorrow&lt;/em&gt;, due to financial difficulties. And that's one of the reasons that he works for himself - there's a lot of machinery in place at organizations to ensure that you aren't &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; sure whether you're on the chopping block or not, or even whether the entire organization is on the verge of collapse. At least he &lt;em&gt;knows&lt;/em&gt; if he's about to be unable to feed himself or his family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, I was fortunate to witness this behavior myself around the time Covid rolled around. In 2020, I worked at an organization that was absolutely rocked by the international travel closures due to a mixture of genuinely unavoidable economic disruption and being a bunch of financially irresponsible buffoons. The &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; thing management did was send an an ancient lich-executive to do the rounds around the floor, noting the empty seats, and joking that "coming into the office is probably &lt;em&gt;safer&lt;/em&gt; that staying home, what with all the empty trains", which I choose to interpret as an attempt to reduce headcount in extremely permanent fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; thing they did was to brutally violently lay off as many people as they could, complete with the whole "we scheduled fifty HR meetings in one day" setup (but remember, we're a family). I still remember that they laid off one of the juniors on my team, basically only sparing me because I am, to quote a Scottish friend, "a charismatic son of a bitch". It is extremely unclear if this is a compliment or not when delivered in a Scottish accent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the response from the employees was unprecedented, and haunted the sociopaths involved for the rest of their days. They - that can't be right. "They forgot about it a year later and continue to say that everyone knows it's basically impossible to get laid off."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, fuck. And the worst part is that the junior they laid off on my team was actually a better programmer than me who &lt;em&gt;exclusively focused on writing good code&lt;/em&gt; instead of setting aside buy-people-coffee money. Again, if I finish read &lt;em&gt;Star Schema: The Complete Reference&lt;/em&gt;, am I going to be any safer? Shouldn't I just be working on my caffeine tolerance? Do I &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; need to step up to cocaine so that I can hang with the big dogs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv"&gt;IV.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A frog is looking for work for his frog-friend. However, the generous frog is a lowly individual contributor, and must instead beg his CEO, a scorpion, to employ his friend. The scorpion declines to employ frog-friend, even when he finds out that frog-friend has tadpoles at home. The horrified frog asks the scorpion why they can't hire frog-friend, to which the scorpion replies: "Well, look, it's just not in the budget for this year, what with the market in decline, and I don't really get to make calls like that. I only have so much political capital to expend this year too. This would have to go to the board."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEO scorpion then hires all his scorpion friends as senior managers. The frog wishes that learning Rust gave it the ability to unilaterally protect its friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I will say about this is that, for the most part, I and readers here have to jump through insane hoops to get friends and fellow travelers hired. We pray that the company happens to have an opening. We pray that the market is good. We hope that the person on the hiring panel isn't going to give the role to a friend (half of my jobs have been promised to me behind the scenes which must have sucked for the other candidates who got fake feedback - I'm convinced that &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; 20%+ of roles have this going on too, even ones where this isn't legal behavior such as in government).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then my friend &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ed-kachelries-a8656193/"&gt;Ed Kachelries&lt;/a&gt; desperately needed his first job in programming, so reader &lt;a href="https://coreysnipes.com/"&gt;Corey Snipes&lt;/a&gt;, a certified absolute legend who runs his own business, just outright hired him for a small gig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would prefer to be in Corey's position, where I've done the hard work of making a business with enough profitability to help out a person that needs it, than to be a beggar and have to tell suffering people "Sorry, the boss says the market is down".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v"&gt;V.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A frog is looking for work for himself, although many other frogs have been saying that the market is totally dead right now, and most scorpions in recruitment won't even talk to him. The frog takes some time to figure out exactly what the scorpions want to see, and then replaces everything on his CV with the same three buzzwords over and over. Within two weeks, he has two job interviews lined up with less than two hours of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first interview, a suspicious scorpion asks "You &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; that you're a frog?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I have over ten years of industry experience in Frog", replies the scorpion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned in my last post that I would look for less stupid work, even if it puts our precious rant sessions in jeopardy. As is my custom when engaging in anything serious, I immediately cooled my blood by 10 C°, carefully considered the state of the industry, then decided to exploit whatever the weakest link is (recruiters and people that don't know how to run interviews) with the precision of an orbital tungsten rod bombardment. I took my CV, scrubbed out every indication of a personality, and put the word "Snowflake" in it over and over because for some reason people think that buying a Snowflake license is going to fix decades of making terrible decisions with their data. Despite the Australian tech market being extremely bad right now, I've got an interview scheduled for Wednesday and finished one last Friday, which I got through extremely easily &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; was offered a A$10K raise over the advertised price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not really sure what to say about the fact that I found work so easily. I just put buzzwords on my CV and added/removed a bit of whitespace to my Seek profile so that I always appears as a recently active candidate. Like, do people think that anyone reads CVs? Recruiters just type in "React" or whatever then sort Seek by "most recently updated". Hopefully that advice helps someone out there - remove all the parts that sound smart and try that for two weeks. Like, literally make a one-page CV with no personality, where you use only have one tech stack, and that stack is whatever the most popular fad is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's just fucking astonishing, right? I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have a CV that says something like "saved a &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/flexible-schemas-are-the-mindkiller/"&gt;A$1.2M project&lt;/a&gt;, then another &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-accidentally-saved-half-a-million-dollars/"&gt;A$500K&lt;/a&gt;,  and oh, and you're looking for communication skills? Well, I just happened to have about a literal million visits to my blog in 2023, here are the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCMtaTi6kMQ"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ7oQ6cUwAw"&gt;times&lt;/a&gt; I ended up on Primagen's YouTube channel, and every year I help loads of people find better work." It turns out that &lt;em&gt;doesn't help at all&lt;/em&gt; on the conventional job market no matter what they say they want in candidates - it just makes it harder for people to tell if I'm the type of cog that you can plug into the Snowflake team to make the data go &lt;em&gt;brrrrrrr&lt;/em&gt;. The industry just wants to see signs that I'm a frog. If you're struggling to find work, there's a chance that &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; need to look more like a frog too. If you're desperate and the bastards want frogs, give them frogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="frog_meme.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/a070c70c.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image is courtesy of &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jlals/?originalSubdomain=au"&gt;Ash&lt;/a&gt;, whose LinkedIn appears to say nothing other than:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skibadee skibadanger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am the data rearranger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ash is incidentally one of my co-directors. What have I &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, the team I was speaking to seemed decent at software engineering, but I was so disgusted by my strategy immediately working that I declined to proceed any further &lt;em&gt;despite being offered more money and the market being in the dumpster&lt;/em&gt;. Plus, you know, if I'm going to sell out it's going to be for &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more money at a company whose CEO isn't the the son of the parent company's CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vi"&gt;VI.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking about this a lot. Firstly, because I will &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; stop finding this picture funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="An image of a scorpion sitting on top of a frog which is drowning. The frog is saying &amp;quot;Why did you sting me? Now we will both surely drown.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Lol&amp;quot; said the scorpion &amp;quot;Lmao&amp;quot;." src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/7d29de7d.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've all been that frog in some point in our lives. It is perhaps not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; accurate to say that software engineers are the ones getting stung all day at companies - many people have a lot in life worse than ours - but that doesn't mean I have to accept things as they stand anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also tell I've been thinking about it a lot because... well, there's this post, but there's also the fact my podcast is actually called &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/does-a-frog-have-scorpion-nature/id1737204926"&gt;Does A Frog Have Scorpion Nature&lt;/a&gt;, which is a name &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; badly optimized for organic growth that you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; someone as scorpion-adjacent as me must be deeply, deeply enamored by the theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also receive a lot of emails from readers who have been in toxic environments for many years, and the thing that always springs to mind is the old (untrue) story about how you can &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog"&gt;boil a frog to death as long as you do it &lt;em&gt;slowly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We're all that frog at some point in our lives too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also a play on a version of a Zen koan I heard listening to Henry Shukman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A monk asked Joshu, 'Does even a dog have Buddha Nature?'
Joshu said, '&lt;em&gt;Mu&lt;/em&gt;.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some &lt;a href="https://www.mountaincloud.org/shukman-case-1-gateless-gate-joshus-dog-mu/"&gt;context&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the koan, “Jôshû’s Dog” (Mu), Case 1 of The Gateless Gate, a monk asks Jôshû if a dog has buddha nature and Jôshû answers, “Mu.” Mu literally means “not,” but can also be taken as, “Don’t go there.” “The more clearly we see what is going on, the more clearly we discover there is only what is going on.” In the practice of Mu we move from there being someone who does the practice, to there being no one doing it — just Mu, nothing but Mu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this we can conclude that I have overloaded the term 'frog' so heavily at this point that it means nothing. But I also suspect the answer to "Does studying programming matter?" is, essentially, "Mu". I have benefited greatly from privileging the study of programming above other things I could have been studying, but that isn't because programming is intrinsically valuable and I'm simply collecting the salary that is rightfully mine - we just have a society right now that demands programmers despite an inability to use them properly. It's nonsense. Sometimes it's useful and sometimes it isn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the framing of programmers as benign frogs that scorpion managers sting isn't quite right. I'm not a scorpion because I worked out how to hack the Seek process. Managers get picked on quite a bit too, just for more money. The frog/scorpion dichotomy throws into stark relief the degree to which there isn't a frog/scorpion dichotomy. Don't go there, no matter how funny it is or how much we enjoy self-pity. There are people who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; view the world this way - I sometimes see people respond to my writing with sincere sentiments like "All managers are scum" (they're all scorpions), and I've been in rooms where management has hired someone after &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; saying "They seem like a loser who will do shitkicker work without leaving" (we want a frog), and they're fucking miserable. It's all a losing game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I'll go a step further and say that even thinking of myself as a &lt;em&gt;software&lt;/em&gt; engineer is some sort of internalized violence to shake off. We're all just... us, right? Calling myself a data engineer might make sense for some sort of short-term contract, in the same way that calling a plumber conveys a lot of useful information when a faucet is leaking, but that isn't really what a permanent office-based role means for most of us. You have to bring a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of yourself to work, especially when you aren't remote, whether you like it or not. And even if you didn't, is it really our first choice to not be ourselves for eight hours a day? Is "data engineer" really the abstraction I want to present to the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a serious responsibility to the people that founded my company with me - I've asked a lot of close friends to trust me when I say that I'm going to try position them for more authentic work and autonomy. They give me a lot of time and energy, with the sincere belief that I am somehow going to position them so that they can do work they believe in (instead of whatever nonsense the market thinks it wants), for sums of money that afford them and their families comfort, with enough reliability that they aren't going to be blown out by outlier events. As much as I would &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; to do nothing other than commit to the full year of technical study I had laid out, I'm starting to realize that the most important skill I can cultivate is being totally agnostic as to whatever skills I decide to cultivate, and any other illusion is a luxury afforded to me because my day jobs have frequently not mattered &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; have been paid for (sometimes a century ago) by someone that bothered to learn the bits that software engineers are largely convinced are beneath them. I don't think this is actually the case, but it's hard to imagine a more perfect conspiracy to keep a lot of inefficient businesses around. A wave of people with holistic business acumen that can &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; single-handedly ship apps would be &lt;em&gt;disastrous&lt;/em&gt; for many, many rent-seekers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a common failure mode here, it is simply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of software engineers (including me) go through phases where we're passionate enough about computing that we try to convince ourselves that it's the pathway to other things we want, because that would be really convenient. Which is, of course, not how the universe works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, it was a short step to believing that, even if my company totally collapses, engaging with the job market as a "software engineer" seems to be a losing proposition (for me, and I suspect many others). And again, worse, a boring proposition. Now that I spend time thinking about the Dark Arts, such as branding and how it affects the dynamics of a sales conversation, I've realized that calling yourself a programmer is a career-defining mistake - outside of very unique specialties like neurosurgery, being in a position where my livelihood is dependent on my title rather than a holistic assessment of my intelligence and capability is like being two moves from forced checkmate. I can still write as much code as I want to a higher standard that I have before, so long as I'm willing to do the work to protect my code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've mentioned in previous posts that I'm deeply interested in psychotherapy and clinical psychology. Something that comes up frequently when I speak to clinicians is that it &lt;em&gt;sucks&lt;/em&gt; to work at many (most?) clinics. They force you to see eight clients a day, back-to-back, so that they can crunch as many billable hours out of the clinicians as possible. This is a &lt;em&gt;horrible&lt;/em&gt; experience. Most of the clinicians I know that escaped this trap seem have started private practices, which means learning about taxes, sales, marketing, renting office spaces, managing client relationships, and all those things that people say "they aren't interested in" without even taking a stab at it. They run a good business, and this is what gives them the sheer profitability required to take care of themselves, and their clients. Do you know how many people tell me they hate negotiating salary when the initial offer is "good enough", then ask me how I afford a three-day work week? Take free money or don't take free money, pick one, but don't complain about it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The space to make specialist decisions and respect the craft to &lt;em&gt;everyone's benefit&lt;/em&gt; is what I want software engineers to reclaim for themselves. And the great news is that because sales books are way more simplistic than programming books (but you can't hide your embarrassing failures in a private repository, you've got to try on a real person), you can hit the &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/you-must-read-at-least-one-book-to-ride/"&gt;one book&lt;/a&gt; level really quickly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my working hours these days are structured around:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing random stuff for this blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audio editing for the podcast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing more stuff for the company website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing a &lt;em&gt;spectacular&lt;/em&gt; amount of work on sales, strategy, and most aspects of whatever you imagine when I say 'business'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As many calls, coffees, lunches, and dinners as I can possibly handle while still enjoying myself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then way at the back, having decided that it isn't actually that important:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading &lt;em&gt;Designing Data Intensive Applications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting some mentorship from a very generous ex-AWS reader&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vii"&gt;VII.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what the strangest thing is, after all of that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having decided that technical study &lt;em&gt;genuinely&lt;/em&gt; isn't important for me right now (this isn't an instance &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines"&gt;Betteridge's law&lt;/a&gt; where I turn around and say that programming study is actually the best), I've never enjoyed my time spent studying more, or learned faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="no-frog.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/4ffd71c1.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/does-a-software-engineer-have-scorpion-nature/</guid></item><item><title>The Controlled Detonation Of My Anonymity</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/the-controlled-detonation-of-my-anonymity/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The time is upon us. I'll try keep it brief because I really don't think who I am is that interesting - but there is a podcast link which might actually be of interest if you wish to indulge in my dulcet tones. All links below may give you adblock warnings as I've shortened the ones containing my name via TinyURL to slow how rapidly this becomes the first page when recruiters look me up. Apologies for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job titles, genders, company domains, tech stacks, and various other details have been obfuscated in my writing from day one. And then I also swapped some details around on LinkedIn, and some jobs are missing entirely from there. Very few things that I've written map cleanly to an employer, and &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; maps clearly to an individual. I'm not in the cyberbullying or doxxing business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i-why"&gt;I. Why?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I have a podcast now, so there's not much point pretending that I'm going to be even remotely anonymous going forward. I called it "Does A Frog Have Scorpion Nature?" which I am extremely proud of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="scorpion.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/3c09cd1b.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can listen to it &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ixt5Cxv8ONoSty6RZDXiv?si=3ede856dad824683"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and I am still figuring out how to publish it in as many places as possible with the right bits and bobs configured. It's with one of the people cited as excellent managers in &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/leadership-is-a-hell-of-a-drug/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leadership Is A Hell Of A Drug&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I'll provide periodic updates as I work this out, but let me know if you want it on a particular platform or it's otherwise missing something you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the less anonymous I am, the more interesting people I meet &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the more context people have for critically thinking about my writing. Is his experience terrible? Are the sectors he works in awful? Does he never stay long enough at companies? Does his beard need trimming?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone also said this would be good for my career, but uh, you read my last two posts, right? We're burning this baby to the ground. Mama didn't raise no coward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-who-am-i"&gt;II. Who Am I?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to use a shortened link to &lt;a href="https://tinyurl.com/mvc4aywz"&gt;my LinkedIn profile&lt;/a&gt; for now so that this blog does not immediately appear upon a Google search - I'm not particularly worried one way or the other, but irreversible is irreversible. I've scrubbed all the borderline lies out of my bio because I couldn't stand the thought of embarrassing myself in front of an audience that I respect. That doesn't say anything good about the LinkedIn community writ large, hah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for actually connecting with me, about 150 people added me when I first said I was contactable over email. It's much easier to do so now. I still don't know exactly what LinkedIn is actually &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; (the answers seem to be largely nothing), but I'd just like to point out that if &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; adds me, I will be able to briefly indulge in watching some grifters I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; dislike become absolutely stunlocked as they try to understand why that random engineer who is mostly known for writing the things they hate has suddenly had their Clout Number 5x. This does nothing for you but would be &lt;em&gt;very funny&lt;/em&gt; for me, and would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-but-really-who-are-you"&gt;III. But Really, Who Are You?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that's all just work history. Here's some cultural background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grew up in Penang, a very small island off the northwest corner of Malaysia. Extremely dense population, not a lot of land. Income also tends not to be very high there - I was lucky enough to grow up in a wealthy family, but most of that wealth resulted in nothing more than engaging with native-born Australians on an equal footing via being able to purchase a visa through education. The education itself was mediocre. My first job in Malaysia paid RM 3,000. This is considered an excellent starting salary there, but is about A$959 a month, so I moved to Australia where I receive that much money to literally just attend standup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hometown, despite being quite built-up, is so lacking in recreational activity that the last time I was there, a friend admitted they had been illegally learning how to tan smuggled zebra hides because it was the only activity they could reach after work in Southeast Asian traffic. I'm as bewildered as you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't speak Malay but was only allowed to attend local schools, so I essentially skipped the first six years of my education. This either did not impact me at all or explains everything. You can decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been in Melbourne since 2013, where I spent four years studying psychology, two years studying data science (after realizing that A$959 was not a good return on investment following the psychology degree), and have been working in I.T ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-are-you-any-good-at-engineering"&gt;IV. Are You Any Good At Engineering?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one has actual career implications for me, but this blog is the no-bullshit zone. If I'm not good enough to hire if it comes down to it, I'd better get used to washing dishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually say that my skills aren't good due to largely working with mediocre people in my professional career. But hey, we're being honest, right? I don't have much on my GitHub, but &lt;a href="https://github.com/Nikhil-Suresh/starfruit/tree/master"&gt;here's a few days of trying Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt; before I got busy. Judge for yourself with what little is there. If it seems like sub-junior work, use my self-immolation to set your own imposter syndrome alight. I reached "senior engineer" in three years at companies that have local name recognition, so presumably that is very surpassable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I seem to earn basically no money for any organization I work at on a day-to-day basis because very few companies can even formulate a coherent monetization strategy for their data, but then occasionally randomly save like A$500K to A$1M because I noticed someone was doing something extremely stupid. I have no idea how that translates to whatever the nebulous skill of software engineering is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the organization &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/my-wild-experience-interviewing-with-real-engineers/"&gt;mentioned here&lt;/a&gt; is likely one of the most elite non-FAANG shops in Melbourne, and they said I "turned the competition's planets into glass via orbital bombardment". If you look at my GitHub, look at that statement, and think "Huh, are standards that low?", the answer is yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. In any case, I guess your boy can turn up when he needs to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most impressive single piece of work I've produced was my Master's thesis, which you can find &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14b0jHeHNFpg9F1kpQdt6X2sApjx-zs8C/view?usp=sharing"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I wrote the entire thing without version control because the university didn't teach it and I was coming out of psychology. I'm also pretty sure my algorithms had massive bugs and I only vaguely understood the math employed. In short, there are a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of things wrong with it but I &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; haven't ever engaged my brain this much since entering the industry. It also did introduce me to one of the most niche books I've ever read, Chris Wallace's &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-387-27656-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Statistical and Inductive Inference by Minimum Message Length&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I don't hone my engineering skill as much as I'd like is that I very quickly realized that 30% of issues presented as software issues &lt;em&gt;actually aren't&lt;/em&gt;, another 30% of them should be solved by buying software (the right software, not the garbage companies normally buy), 30% of them shouldn't be solved &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;, and I will only consider writing software in 5% of cases. The last 5% is for &lt;em&gt;actually complicated&lt;/em&gt; software. I'm not sure if this means that I have business acumen or if I'm too scared of committing to maintaining technical solutions because they're fun enough to be a siren song, but maybe it means I'm employable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v-what-about-your-company"&gt;V. What About Your Company?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company I founded with the team is &lt;a href="https://www.hermit-tech.com/"&gt;Hermit Technology&lt;/a&gt;. Not much else to say there - I'm not here to sell you anything. If we can actually help you, I'm not going to say no, but what I &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; want is for everyone to realize that you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; just start a business. The first steps are only slightly harder than just turning up to work to be Scrummed at, but it's a lot more interesting, and for the most part has been totally fine. I think some business models and becoming super rich are hard, but it's already quite obvious to me that halfway talented programmers can pretty easily earn a living without begging a big company to hang around their office for 40 hours a week. And I really think that grifters have turned honesty into the hottest commodity there is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, there it is. I called an accountant and a lawyer, forked over a negligible amount of money, and it's done. You can just like, do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vi-whats-up-with-the-podcast"&gt;VI. What's Up With The Podcast?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm probably going to aim for an episode every month or so. There's a lot to learn about interviewing &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; audio editing, and I think the second episode will be much better. But frankly, while the first episode has issues, I suspect even mostly removing background noise means I've tried harder than most. However, it does take a lot of time and is currently unmonetized, so I'll still be largely focused on writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can send me feedback on it at ludicity.hackernews@gmail.com. Both positive and negative feedback are greatly welcomed, as I know there is both massive room for improvement &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; I won't keep producing it if there are no indications that anyone enjoys it. However, if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; enjoy it, giving it a share would be nice. I had fun doing it and would actually really like to continue, with the caveat that I want to make a podcast for &lt;em&gt;actual listeners&lt;/em&gt;, not the void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that the original version of it sounded &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; and I benefited greatly from the help of &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/crenshawda/"&gt;Dennis Crenshaw&lt;/a&gt;, who introduced me to Reaper with step-by-step instructions on not being an incompetent moron. He's also in the U.S and needs work urgently - and when I say urgently, we're talking "I am lighting the beacons of Gondor because my man only has a month or two of runway due to family care". He likes Clojure, okay? You won't regret having him around. This is me, man possibly using his career to fuel the beacons, vouching for him. There are no more expensive signals of honesty available in my arsenal. Reach out to him directly on Bad Platform or email me for a connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vii-whats-next"&gt;VII. What's Next?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing, really. I'm going to stay focused on getting my consulting business off the ground, on writing, and try to go to the gym more often. I don't think the tone of my writing will change a whole lot - I already avoid saying anything that would target a specific individual and have added enough misdirection to my worst stories that no one really has a reason to come after me, unless they &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to put their hands up and go: "Yes, that's me. I am the person that wastes millions and can't use Git".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll let you know if I end up getting fucking shot in the head by someone in a suit that doesn't like honesty, or if I'm forced into working at KFC. Godspeed, you glorious bastards.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/the-controlled-detonation-of-my-anonymity/</guid></item><item><title>The Violence Of Relentless Positivity In The Workplace</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/the-violent-role-of-relentless-positivity-in-the-workplace/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This post is enormous, clocking in at 7.5K words. Strap yourselves in, make some tea, and I hope you can forgive any typos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walsh: That's &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; opinion.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hitchens: Well, guess what? Guess who's saying it? That's a very clever thing to say. Shall I ask, would you prefer I answer with &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; opinion? What a fatuous remark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i"&gt;I.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have, for the most part, entirely ignored the most senseless negative comments on my writing. Scour the archives and you will see - I'll engage a coherent critique and ignore tone policing. Some of the stupidest &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; arguably most accurate comments are on &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/compliments/"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;, and I leave identifying the appropriate category as an exercise to the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, my reflections on leadership in &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/leadership-is-a-hell-of-a-drug/"&gt;Leadership Is A Hell Of A Drug&lt;/a&gt; held the #1 spot on Hackernews for some time, which comes with hundreds of comments. To recap, it was a rant about being dragged into an insane four hour meeting where nothing was said, and a reflection on how self-identifying as a "leader" is very concerning behavior. I have a great fondness for the Hackernews crowd, as they are by-and-large "my people", but some of the garnered criticism illustrated a class of corporate tone policing blatant enough to warrant some writing. Today, I want to talk about why positivity is so highly-prized in politicized environments, the psychological violence of tone policing and how it impoverishes people spiritually, and how I think about the cynicism of my writing as a person that wants to move &lt;em&gt;beyond&lt;/em&gt; giving people hope and catharsis, and instead improving their material conditions too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, given that I am sure much of the critique was well-intentioned, I will reply in a respectful and proportiona-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This person sounds like an energy vampire. I don't disagree with some of the points, but the way they're conveyed and the writing style make it hard to empathize with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="An image of an American warship firing a massive broadside." src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/99f7c33c.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii"&gt;II.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a whole cowardly vocabulary available to attack your fellows in group settings, the most famous of which is "not a team player". I will concede that "energy vampire" is much funnier, more biting in two senses of the word, the writer probably means it because they stand to gain nothing, they didn't say something as personally targeted as "&lt;em&gt;you're&lt;/em&gt; an energy vampire", and we don't share a social network so all charges of cowardice are dropped. They probably didn't really feel like they were addressing a real person, which is fine because I wholeheartedly embrace my vampire status. We would likely get along with a minimal of fuss at an office, if only because I suspect they would be a relentless source of nourishment, and I have said stupider things than this in my life. I really have no issue with this person in particular, they've just rolled the natural one and have been singled out. We can get coffee and laugh about how we've both behaved if you're ever in the area. And even though my audience is likely not large enough for this to be necessary, it goes without saying that &lt;em&gt;anyone mentioned should be left in peace&lt;/em&gt;. There, that's enough throat clearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a fucking &lt;em&gt;stupid&lt;/em&gt; thing to say. What are you &lt;em&gt;talking&lt;/em&gt; about? In a company that bills itself as remote-first, we're dragging somewhere between 20-40 people to a four-hour meeting that attendees only commented on with "absolutely hilarious" and "the world has gone mad" and &lt;em&gt;I'm&lt;/em&gt; the energy vampire because I decided to write about it? Because you don't like my tone? What parasite do I need to avoid to steer clear of this particular strain of brain rot? The only saving grace of this comment is that it is the least asinine of those which will follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This person &lt;em&gt;agreed&lt;/em&gt; with what I said. They &lt;em&gt;said&lt;/em&gt; as much, so presumably the thing that makes me an energy vampire is that I thought it was okay &lt;em&gt;to express my true feelings on a platform no one forced them to read&lt;/em&gt;. This, in itself, is fine, firstly because they also expressed themselves on a platform that I wasn't forced to read, and secondly because their frustration is the only thing that my fell species can subsist on. The only thing that needs explaining is how my expression of negativity, especially when it is &lt;em&gt;very easy&lt;/em&gt; to infer that management has committed other transgressions, revealed my membership in the dread court of the night (my local chapter of Agile consultants).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here's my attempt at explaining it. Amongst people in power at the average (read: dysfunctional) organization, non-positivity is incredibly dangerous. Amongst people that are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in power at an organization, they're so used to the dysfunction never changing, no matter what action is undertaken, that processing the reality of the situation is a waste of precious energy which they could spend staring blankly into space or daydreaming about living in a meritocracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-the-instrumental-utility-of-positivity"&gt;III. The Instrumental Utility Of Positivity&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To appreciate that positivity is both highly sought-after &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; is something that should be viewed with suspicion by moral people, we must consider the delicate balance of power in most companies. A family friend, who happens to run a major government institution, once told me that a manager's &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; job is to control the flow of negative information that reaches their boss. This is repeated independently in Jackall's &lt;em&gt;Moral Mazes&lt;/em&gt; and again, equally cynically, in Slava Akmechet's &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231129015851/https://www.spakhm.com/p/how-to-get-promoted"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How To Get Promoted&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a first-hand example of the insane hoops people jump through in order to only project positivity. The most popular post I ever wrote was on &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-accidentally-saved-half-a-million-dollars/"&gt;saving half a million dollars for my employer&lt;/a&gt;. In summary, it turned out we were burning approximately A$500,000 per year on idling computers in an organization that is currently losing money every year. I fixed it despite immense pushback and was awarded... &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/tech-management-has-bestowed-glory-upon-me/"&gt;A$60 in gift vouchers&lt;/a&gt;. In the aftermath of this, I had to have a meeting with my team's lead engineer to prepare a presentation. This meeting was &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; blatant about burying the truth, and we removed everything which suggested a mistake had been made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That presentation then went to my director, which went to our lowest-ranked member of the C-suite, which finally went to the CFO. At each level, the message was refined into a purer grade of bullshit. I obtained a copy of it a few months ago, and was absolutely gobsmacked by the sheer breathtaking audacity and ugliness of the lies, which consisted of statements &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; misleading enough to trick a non-technician, and visualizations that were totally inaccurate but could be claimed to be merely illustrative of the general phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, we had &lt;em&gt;halved&lt;/em&gt; our bill and saved A$500K. How do you report on that without someone saying that we must have misconfigured something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misconfigured? &lt;em&gt;Misconfigured?&lt;/em&gt; If you say such a thing in my presence again, I will demand satisfaction, sirrah! No, rather than halving our bill, we had &lt;em&gt;doubled&lt;/em&gt; the possible capacity of users on the platform for the same price! Wow, we sound like we aren't fucking idiots when you put it that way! Of course, we had doubled it to the number it was supposed to be when we initially requested all this money from the organization, but we're just going to leave that out and hope no one asks about it. I'm sure glad that we didn't do anything wrong, or we would be culpable for the person that lost their job the week prior. Phew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the actual fix? Surely someone is going to ask about how we set the literal UI field that said "How long do you want to idle this computer after a one second query for?" to ten minutes. Ah, well, you just leave all the absolute numbers out. They put in a little manually-fidgeted-out-of-Powerpoint-shapes chart that showed that &lt;em&gt;previously&lt;/em&gt; the computer would operate for a minute, then idle for a minute. Thanks to "efficiencies we had identified through careful analysis of user behavior" (i.e, we did the thing I had been saying to do for months because it was obvious), the computer now operates for a minute, then idles for &lt;em&gt;half&lt;/em&gt; a minute! Not bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course... the queries were actually running for a second and then idling for &lt;em&gt;ten minutes&lt;/em&gt;, so we needed one pixel of "operate" to &lt;em&gt;fucking six-hundred pixels&lt;/em&gt; of "idle". But we did this chart out of hand-drawn squares, so who could blame us for approximating! Oh, and the minimum timeout on these computers is one minute, so we still get one second of query for a sixty second bill. We genuinely can't help that, but we &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; don't tell anyone because it still &lt;em&gt;sounds bad&lt;/em&gt;. Bad is &lt;em&gt;verboten&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the absurd lengths people go to in order to prevent negative information flowing up the chain. The reasons for this are manifold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, many people in power are simply nuts. I was speaking to a reader over dinner yesterday, who has a great deal more work experience than me and has served as a CEO of small companies. We were on the topic of avoiding narcissists in our consulting businesses, and I noticed that they had advised me to avoid narcissists about three times over our last two meetings. I have very little insight into the personality of my management because they're always lying to me (in very positive terms) so I asked this reader what percentage of people exhibited such behavior. Their guess was 5% in the general population, up to 10-20% amongst executives due to selection pressure. Very understandably, you do not want to give such a person ammunition to use against you, and because most senior leaders all behave in exactly the same way for &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/the-corporate-facade-is-more-complicated-than-i-thought/"&gt;complex reasons&lt;/a&gt;, you have no idea who you're talking to. A 15% chance, to meet that estimate in the middle, is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; close to rolling a six when playing Monopoly. Would you roll the dice on giving someone like that more power over you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, leaders, especially non-technical leaders, are completely reliant on reports from staff operating below them. This means that you're always in some dumb game theory experiment. If everyone is honest and the leader is sane, life is good. At any moment, a manager can begin under-reporting failures and then they're going to have meteoric career progression when competing against honest actors. Hell, you can't even be totally protected by a meta-heuristic of "only trust people that sometimes say negative things" because some people are cunning and this strategy is in the metagame. From Slava Akmechet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course you can't seem like you never deliver bad news either. It's a matter of packaging. Bad news is never individualized. If you ever carelessly imply that some team may be doing something poorly, you will make yourself a target for every opportunist in the company. Instead, bad news is always delivered in general terms and always as a matter of slight adjustments to a continuous variable, never as a binary switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, naturally, leads to a stable equilibrium where everything is always positive, unless the problems are minor, and the solution is preferably to hire more staff. Note that you &lt;em&gt;don't even need real sociopaths to do this&lt;/em&gt;. Anyone that learns through Pavlovian conditioning that negativity is bad will do well, and anyone that believes &lt;em&gt;hire more programmers&lt;/em&gt; is an effective way to deliver software projects faster (which is largely wrong but not &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; wrong to most) will also build an empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it sure &lt;em&gt;helps&lt;/em&gt; to be a sociopath, don't get me wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The net effect of this is that &lt;em&gt;positivity is suspicious&lt;/em&gt; because it has so much instrumental value and is deployed relentlessly by awful people. Yes, sure, that's good if it's true, but is also basically indistinguishable from someone that's secretly &lt;em&gt;the worst&lt;/em&gt;. And then to make it worse, they say they can't be the awful ones, because why would an awful person be so positive? There's no justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I loved the book &lt;em&gt;Turn The Ship Around!&lt;/em&gt; but was unwilling to endorse it until I heard the author express negativity on the podcast &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/nudge-61-with-david-marquet/id1707924562?i=1000633646689"&gt;Radio Free XP&lt;/a&gt;. Negativity is an expensive signal of honesty, and if it isn't expensive then it's a bad signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-positivity-amongst-employees"&gt;IV. Positivity Amongst Employees&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amongst employees, the phenomenon of positivity is not explained away so neatly. While it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; help employees to get promotions, the average employee is even less likely to be a will-to-power freak that wants to crush everything around them like little insects. We &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; want to earn an honest wage, and are unwilling to cultivate an endless facade. For the most part, employees at dysfunctional organizations are simply conditioned, day in and day out, to view conflict as some sort of life-and-death struggle that must be avoided at all costs, and negativity as dumping barrels of toxic waste into their beautiful stream of thought. Where sociopaths derive material benefits from forced positivity, employees instead use it to blot out the reality of how they're spending forty hours a week of their precious lives attending meetings designed to futilely prevent clowns from making every production input a spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my eyes, negativity, when not taken to perverse levels, is simply the act of saying "This thing is bad, and more than that, it is bad to the degree that it is a high priority to fix".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was getting drinks with one of the saner engineer organizations in Melbourne last week - and this is a total aside, but the managers I've met through this blog seem to have staff retention ranging between 2-5x higher than the industry norm. A few drinks in, I remarked that most teams viewed conflict as something to be avoided at all costs. This is the point where &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; of the lead engineers at that table, who I respect immensely for both their people skills, ethics, and engineering talent, yelled out something along the lines of "Why?!". This probably wouldn't normally warrant a yell, but I must remind you that we &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; a few drinks in. It turns out that both of them actively cultivate cultures where disagreement is viewed as a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; thing because that is an indicator that you're moving closer to the truth. And if you've hired adults, disagreement is actually quite pleasant. You learn a lot, it keeps you engaged, your work turns out better, and this in turn leads to more happiness down the line. And yes, you &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; get to clock out at 5PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;haven't&lt;/em&gt; hired adults, then trying to improve anything is like pushing a boulder up a hill. You push, and push, and push, and then finally give up and it rolls back down the hill. It is very tiring and utterly pointless. Even if the boulder &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; at the top of the hill, it usually isn't going to cure cancer, but instead ensure that the organization is able to respond to customer complaints 3% faster. This has social utility, but &lt;em&gt;not enough&lt;/em&gt; for me to push that boulder for forty years and then fucking &lt;em&gt;die&lt;/em&gt;. You only get to push three boulders, if you're lucky, over your whole career. This is why people email me and say they're burned out - they've been pushing the wrong boulder for years, while grifters, morons, and well-meaning people that still think This Boulder Is Important occasionally &lt;em&gt;make the rock heavier&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt;, I believe, is why the commenter I picked out chose the phrase "energy vampire" - not because they really think I'm an awful person, but because it must be &lt;em&gt;so exhausting&lt;/em&gt; if you agree with my points and further believe that it's inescapable. Everyone has resignedly decided to stop pushing the boulder and, blessedly, the organization has agreed to this in exchange for everyone loudly proclaiming that the rock is already at the top of the hill. The &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; possible outcome of someone pointing out that the chunk of granite is at an absolute nadir, if you have given up on ever escaping your prison, is that someone might ask you to push it again &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; now you have to think about what a wretched creature you have become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a weird way, I agree with the spirit of the energy vampire comment. The reason I don't say these things at work is largely not because I'm scared of being fired. It's because &lt;em&gt;I don't want to drain people's energy for no reason&lt;/em&gt;. There is an approximately 0% chance that things are actually going to improve at most organizations, which is why &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/your-organization-probably-doesnt-want-to-improve-things/"&gt;I wrote exactly that&lt;/a&gt; and it resonated with many people. The remarkable thing here is that some people internalize that anti-negativity, knee-jerk, self-preservation reaction so deeply that they'll call me out over it over mediums where I am &lt;em&gt;explicitly not complaining at my actual place of work&lt;/em&gt; and they don't have to show off to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, I think both compulsory 4-hour meetings and long rants complaining about them are a bummer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These comments are sad to see, and I commiserate, even with the "energy vampire" fellow. We can agree to disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get what you give and the tone in this piece doesn’t sound like someone willing to give anything, not even four hours of their already-shortened workweek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly. While he may be very good at something, this kind of person is a net negative for a team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These comments are made by dweebs and society will be better off when I finish feeding off their auras, leaving naught but lifeless corpses undergoing a fifty year death rattle that just happens to sound like someone talking about sprint velocity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v-tone-policing"&gt;V. Tone Policing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone that has, whether by luck or skill, consistently been able to get eyes on their writing - and here's some deep lore, I used to have another, now defunct, blog when I was 21 that also had a thousand readers on the first day - I can tell you right now that you cannot have &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; opinions on the internet without attracting criticism. Some of it is valid, but &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of it is pretty stupid. My old writing was about epistemic issues in psychology, which are utterly unsurprising to any competent statistician on the field or anyone with a brain. I was young enough that I didn't swear or take an aggressive tone, and it was actually quite mild, but my critique was still ultimately scathing - and ten years later, it was still all correct. The only thing that has changed is that now I don't think undergraduate psychology courses being silly is that important. Nonetheless, some midwits from the University of Reddit immediately replied with accusations that I must be a Scientologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a formative experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, you will have to deal with the painful reality that some of the people who &lt;em&gt;agree&lt;/em&gt; with you are probably the exact kind of person that you've been accused of being. Them's the breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to be utterly okay with the idea of writing something stupid, and accept that you're going to get what's coming to you. Or be very arrogant. Again, an exercise for the reader to decide. It's not for everyone, but it's fine for more people than you'd think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to avoid this is to be so utterly bland and sanitized that there's nothing for anyone to object to. People don't object to my writing because I actually &lt;em&gt;swear&lt;/em&gt; sometimes, they object because they don't like the broader tone, and that tone is one in which swearing might happen but is hardly the important part. I &lt;em&gt;hated&lt;/em&gt; Taleb the first time I read him - I said &lt;em&gt;The Black Swan&lt;/em&gt; was the worst book I'd ever read and that Taleb was a smug jerk - until I had enough life experience to go back and appreciate it. I've been the tone police, and I'm the poorer for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases it is just people being stupid, but consider the psychologists that asserted that I'm a Scientologist. From personal experience, they are very happy when I turn up and say that we need to make some small improvements to our scientific rigor, because this is actually evidence that they &lt;em&gt;don't need to change anything&lt;/em&gt;. Each discussion they have in calm, polite tones, very careful not to step on anyone's toes, does not move them closer to fixing anything, it moves them closer to doing nothing. In almost any large institution, be it a company, lab, or sports team, any priority that is not the highest is going to be completely abandoned. The mental model most people have (including me in the past) is that you're incrementally building the case for fixing the system, but you are actually consolidating the status of the issue as utterly unimportant. The two ways to avoid addressing an issue are to ignore it &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; to repeatedly discuss it in mild terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignoring it is dangerous, because someone might turn up and say "Holy shit, we've been falsifying our results! The emperor wears no clothes! &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/6/13/17449118/stanford-prison-experiment-fraud-psychology-replication"&gt;Zimbardo was a fraud!&lt;/a&gt;", and now you are forced to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much safer is to firmly cement it as a priority... just a priority that isn't even close to the highest. That way you &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; get to ignore it, but whenever someone says "Oh my God, shouldn't we stop the database from burning A$500K, and why do we have all these meetings, and why does the codebase have no tests?", you can now say "Ah yes, we've collectively decided that nothing needs to change, and we've actually got lots of cultural history within the organization to confirm that you're acting &lt;em&gt;crazy&lt;/em&gt; right now". All you have to do at most companies is pop open your Jira backlog and look at all the languishing low-priority cards - they are functionally deleted as long as higher priority work continues to come in, which is &lt;em&gt;for eternity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the same reason that it's so easy for people to behave poorly in short bursts over extended periods of time, be it a manager or your roommate that only cleans the dishes once every two weeks. If each individual transgression doesn't seem to &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; warrant a HR complaint or a conversation, you just sort of sit there repeatedly thinking "That was an awful thing to do". When you finally snap, which I've seen someone do after being bullied for months, they were cast as being utterly unreasonable over a single slightly aggressive message. When they started to bring up the receipts over the past few months, they were quickly cast as an insane non-team-player, because who the hell keeps a log of those minor transgressions &lt;em&gt;even though that is the only possible way to deal with such behavior&lt;/em&gt;? Yes, there are tones that are inappropriate for the workplace, but you don't deal with this by having oppressive social norms, you handle this by hiring functional people that are willing to learn and think of others, and &lt;em&gt;certainly&lt;/em&gt; not by expecting your employees to be milquetoast robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, not if you want to be the sort of person that really cares about not wasting forty hours of precious human time and wisdom, per colleague, per week, for the entirety of your career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tone is a &lt;em&gt;vital&lt;/em&gt; part of communicating your emotional reality and mental health situation. The relentless demand for employees to express themselves in ways that are necessarily inadequate for affecting organizational change, implicating others in unacceptable behavior, and voicing authenticity is, to my eyes, nothing short of a form of violence. I'd certainly take it over having someone work my kneecaps over with a lead pipe, but I assure you that vulnerable people have absolutely been harmed by this over extended periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the nature of my writing, I am frequently in correspondence with people that have paid the price of dealing with toxic environments for &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt;, before finally realizing that everyone around them has either been quietly suffering &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; actively exploiting them. I've been that person, though at least in my case I was born cynical and knew I was being exploited over visa conditions. A lot of damage can be done before you realize that it's time to distance yourself from such a relationship. I spend a fair amount of time connecting readers with each other, hopefully in a way that helps them find a better life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, these absolute motherfuckers are out here vomiting whatever half-digested thoughts they've formed after admitting they didn't finish reading the article, then (metaphorically) accusing people of being Scientologists. I hope you stub both your toes, break out in an embarrassing rash, then get asked to manage your organization's SharePoint. Your opinions are but the minuscule, crystalline hell-facets of the jet-black chandelier hanging in Satan's bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just punched the word 'gaslit' into my inbox. I have no idea what that word means anymore, but we all get the vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for writing your blog. It decreases my anxiety a lot whenever I read it. Makes me feel normal and right instead of feeling frustrated and gaslit by various managers around me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're all people who work for a class of people that have built a cult around getting engineers to drink the kool aid and gaslight themselves into finding a third end to burn their candles at.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this day, I'm not entirely sure what happened. I think I did make one or two mistakes, but instead of ever correcting or addressing them, my boss bullied and gaslit me, and then fired me anyway. It was traumatic.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like I've spent the last 2 years being consistently gaslit by incompetents, self-unreflective rogues, and complicit psychos who won't get their personality disorders managed. I'm sure you've noticed it in the comments on HN whenever your blog is posted there: tone-policing, nit-picking, and more social theatre. Amusing if you can step back and see it for what it is, but very "unbalancing" (as you've aptly written before) when you're surrounded by it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On behalf of these readers, get a backbone, some opinions that aren't corporate-approved kipple, and then go fuck yourselves to restore some karmic balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vi-the-case-for-cynicism-bred-optimism"&gt;VI. The Case For Cynicism-Bred Optimism&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a danger, upon really seeing corporate dysfunction for the first time, that one might become so cynical that they lose their will to continue striving &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; to give up on their values. It is a very, very real danger. I know at least one person who I otherwise like who has developed &lt;em&gt;atrocious&lt;/em&gt; intuitions around how to treat people in the workplace... which he picked up from watching administrators at mental healthcare institutions and hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February of 2023, I was in danger of falling into that first category. I was starting to believe that there was really no way to ethically earn a living (sufficiently good to own a house one day) that wasn't tantamount to accepting that I'd be pushed around by empty suits all day. Many of the happier people I spoke with simply had kids and didn't really care about all the time wasted at work as long as it kept their children happy... which is also fine, but I don't have kids. Many of the smarter engineers that I spoke to over that period admitted that they just want to earn the highest pay possible for the smallest amount of time - which I respect, but they said it in away that indicated they aren't actually very happy with that arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get it. The world is frequently wearying. From your refrigerator breaking down to a family member falling ill, there are days where it feels like you're simply getting insult and insult heaped upon you, usually topped off by being stuck on traffic to mull them all over. In my case, I found there was a period where I wallowed a little bit, and then you simply have to get on with things. Everyone is allowed to fall into a miserable heap sometimes, for &lt;em&gt;months&lt;/em&gt; if they need to, but eventually you have to get back on the horse, whether that's going for a run or getting back to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, there are many people who want to pretend that everything is awesome or are willfully blind. This is why someone so esteemed as Rich Hickey felt it necessary to say, in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc"&gt;hammock-driven development&lt;/a&gt; that "not everything is awesome". Everything being awesome is a plague. They're highly-attuned to the good things that exist in nearly every person, and deathly allergic to cynicism as a vibe-killer. Hence the ol' "long rants are a bummer" viewpoint. Bummer aversion makes for pleasant people typing alongside you, or to get coffee with, but extremely reluctant allies against most institutional issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quote one of the co-directors at my own company:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're supportive! ...Just of everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, I run into tons of people that never leave the doom-and-gloom zone. Sometimes they have seen so much awful stuff with no visible way out that they give up. Sometimes, less attractively, they think cynicism is the same thing as wisdom. Everyone is allowed to be a sad sack - I was probably awful to be around when I was depressed - but I was allowed to energy drain friends and family long enough to write this today, more full of piss and vinegar than ever before. After a few months, if you're able, the "everything is hopeless" needs to be discarded. I'm fully of sympathy for someone that can't get themselves out of bed on some days, but I hope you'll &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; to get out sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More frequently though, the cynical people are highly-attuned to injustice and bullshit. If you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; believe that the organization just needs to Be More Agile, there's nothing at all offensive in attending a four hour meeting on that topic. If you don't, then you see this meeting as representative of a process that drains people's souls every day across the world, and you think of the social patterns that allows that to happen, and the next thing you know you're &lt;em&gt;livid&lt;/em&gt; because this four hour meeting is emblematic of why every database at every hospital I've worked at has been a fucking dumpster fire that statistically kills patients through sheer inefficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'll lay a few things out, and they're going to be positive. I'm simply going to have to live with the fact that they may sound preachy or self-help. I'm very wary of falling into what one reader called the "advice-giving archetype", but I have advice to give nonetheless. It's all my opinion and some of it may not be good... but I can't give someone else's opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="falling-headfirst-into-the-advice-giving-archetype"&gt;Falling Headfirst Into The Advice-Giving Archetype&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="i-finding-work"&gt;I. Finding Work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've mentioned before that I don't believe that large, dysfunctional environments can be fixed from the inside. There are a few rare exceptions, such as David Marquet becoming a submarine captain and being able to just &lt;em&gt;demand&lt;/em&gt; new initiatives be tried, but you aren't going to be a submarine captain. The case for hope lies not in trying to transform dysfunctional places (this strikes me as like trying to transform a toxic partner), but in playing a different game entirely. The recurring theme in my case for hopefulness isn't related to some wishy-washy "educate your stakeholders and they'll respect your work" LinkedIn-approved nonsense. It's that if your tactics are sophisticated and you leverage some authenticity, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; escape such environments or alter your relationship with them - such as coming in as a very expensive consultant or going freelance. Yes, my employer gave me a vaguely insulting gift card. On the other hand, I strongarmed them into letting me work three days a week for 1.5 years because they kept scoring own-goals, and their general incompetence was the fuel for this blog. That's not a terrible trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJL9M5uAJSc"&gt;Dry land&lt;/a&gt; and good workplaces are not a myth! I've seen them! I haven't gotten permission to namedrop any of them here in Melbourne (okay, &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; company) but they're out there. I've got a standing invitation to get drinks with one group here - they play Factorio together, all their keyboards have thirty keys, and generally just seem to be having a great time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aforementioned good companies take a lot of work to find. There are a surprising number of them, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; they avoid gross political issues due to staying small. Because they're nice to be at, they have lengthy average stays. I.e, they have a small number of positions that are infrequently vacated, so if you want to be at one of them, start networking &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; and you can probably get one in 1-2 years. Also they will sometimes implode if the founders move on. Them's also the breaks, but at that point you'll have a network that only accepts high quality. There, now you've got a responsibility to go find one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doom-and-gloom around big companies is warranted, but the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; big companies are orders of magnitude better than the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; big companies. I'm pretty confident that I'm at a median institution and it still rots my brain, so just imagine how bad the worst ones are. &lt;em&gt;Don't be at the worst ones&lt;/em&gt;, and keep pushing until you're happy. Don't compromise as long as your other life circumstances allow for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some social causes require working at a big company, and that's okay if you really care about them. My friends and I joke about looking for the mythical data job of CancerDB, the terribly designed database that you maintain to help cure cancer. I'll push that boulder to cure cancer, I will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; do that to increase Google's ad revenue 0.0001%. For many people, once you have kids, every company is basically CancerDB because it feeds your kids and sends them to college. That's fair enough, but it's no wonder that those of us that aren't at that stage of their life (or never intend to be) get so antsy in the same environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ii-health"&gt;II. Health&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I traded A$50,000 in 2023 (by going down to three days a week) in exchange for getting my health back. I really didn't appreciate my health until I lost it, and now that it's back and I can work again, you can be sure I'm not going to waste it on the kind of malevolent jerks I write about &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/flexible-schemas-are-the-mindkiller/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. If you're younger than me (and I'm not old) and haven't been through the ringer yet, address any declines in your physical or mental health with an embarrassment of firepower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="iii-everything-is-tactics"&gt;III. Everything Is Tactics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not having a degree doesn't matter if you're cunning. Frankly, if you aren't cunning, basically nothing moves the needle drastically, in my experience. However, they are a useful way to legally buy a temporary visa in a first-world country, which is probably very relevant to some readers. Other than that, they aren't an excuse to not try to do better. It takes three years to get a degree, and you can luck into several really good jobs by studying and networking for three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over dinner yesterday, the reader I was with (the same &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/my-company-has-earned-its-first-paycheck/"&gt;David Kellam mentioned here&lt;/a&gt;) described Human-Computer Interaction as a series of models colliding. You have the model of the system, the mental model of the user, and the mental model of the designer. It is the designer's job to make the system's interface conform to what the user imagines. This is why I can reliably find the power switch on every model of kettle I've ever run into, but had to spend ten hours reading Pro Git to really understand how to rebase things. I mention this because my first thought was of the people I know that flail at institutions and their life circumstances ineffectively. Systems don't care what you &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; of them, only what they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;, and this is why I think cynicism is a necessary component of personal happiness. Given that we &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; good workplaces and happiness exist, given sufficient time and adequate tactics, these things are attainable by most people. Positivity is well and good, but must be paired with the greatest strategy and tactics that you can conceive of and  execute on. You have to take the right actions because material conditions and strategy matter. Cynicism lets you perceive this when well-calibrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also means that everyone has to take responsibility for seeking a way out, not because you should be blaming yourself, but because no one is really able to do it for you. But we can help, which is why I still connect readers one-at-a-time while my partner disapprovingly mentions how many emails I'm replying to. By the way, you wouldn't &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; the number of emails I get from people that say something like "I work in abusive shit-hole staffed by malicious demons", followed pretty quickly by "And I've been here for five years and haven't really looked for a new job".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. Ahem. You have to take the right actions because material conditions and strategy matter, and staying at a garbage organization without even &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to leave is terrible strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I meet people who say that they aren't too worried about money, usually after failing to negotiate at all beyond the first offer they ever received.  They are not really fooling anyone - they panicked and wanted an excuse to not talk about money, which is convenient for employers and not for them. The reason I can work three days a week is that I maxed out the money slider enough that I could afford the pay cut, and frankly, I'm not that good at it. You have to take the right actions because material conditions and strategy matter, and &lt;em&gt;not taking free money&lt;/em&gt; is terrible strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your exit plan is to start your own business that pays your income rather than aiming for bajillions of dollars, in 99% of cases, building something &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; a third-party has committed social or monetary capital is probably a bad idea. The most common failure mode for engineers is to build something and watch as the mythical "they" absolutely &lt;em&gt;do not come&lt;/em&gt;, so you should have a violent reaction towards any course that could conceivably result in this outcome. You have to take the right actions because material conditions and strategy matter. Not noticing the trail of skulls of people that went down that pathway in the jungle is terrible strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/07/yes-we-have-noticed-the-skulls/"&gt;Look. I’m the last person who’s going to deny that the road we’re on is littered with the skulls of the people who tried to do this before us. But we’ve noticed the skulls. We’ve looked at the creepy skull pyramids and thought “huh, better try to do the opposite of what those guys did”.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Networking is not an ugly thing, provided you don't do it with ugly intent or disreputable people. I only became convinced of this when I realized that there are enough cool people in the world to allow me to network exclusively with the type of person that will play Helldivers 2 with me, at which point this is indistinguishable from friendship. Almost all good things will come to you through good people, so this is the most valuable resource that exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying to jobs by optimising your CV is dreadful. Build your network, then rely on your network. Understand that many people hiring don't know what they want, and if you desperately need an exit, just say whatever they want to hear. If they ask if you're good at Python and you think you're a beginner, just say you're an expert. This applies to all subjective questions. Anyone stupid enough to ask questions like that without verifying the answers makes you an expert relative to them anyway. This is another game-theoretic situation where you will lose to confident hucksters if you don't improve your game. Say it with me: You have to take the right actions because material conditions and strategy matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="iv-on-evil"&gt;IV. On Evil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being evil is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; necessary unless you want to be rich beyond the dreams of avarice, are desperate (in rare cases), or your tactics are so bad that you can't afford any constraints. This is a cause for great celebration because this is not a moral truth, just a convenient fact about how society is configured. There is another universe where everyone works in the acid mines and being honest is always incorrect, and we thankfully don't live there despite what some people say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't lie to people that are well-and-truly in your network and tribe. No one cares what you tell an oil company when your spouse needs healthcare, but if you get a job through this blog, for example, you had better be telling the truth because real people are going out on a limb for you. And being a good person &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; better for your soul and your material circumstances, as long as you are careful to save true vulnerability for other good people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistulae_Morales_ad_Lucilium"&gt;There are certain people who tell any person they meet things that should only be confided to friends, unburdening themselves of whatever is on their minds into any ear they please. Others again are shy of confiding in their closest friends, and would not even let themselves, if they could help it, into the secrets they keep hidden deep down inside themselves. We should do neither. Trusting everyone is as much a fault as trusting no one (though I should call the first the worthier and the second the safer behaviour).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vii-a-personal-note"&gt;VII. A Personal Note&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A commenter wrote this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39626221"&gt;My rule is “If you’re complaining you better be quitting”.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is a fair point. Also their name is Tea, Earl Grey, Cold. Such a person deserves respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been lounging around my mediocre employer for long enough, and I think it's about time I moved on. There's complaining for fun, and then there's &lt;em&gt;complaining&lt;/em&gt;. I'm going to be 30 this year and it is dawning on me that I don't have time to waste on these people. While writing this, I reached out to my manager and let him know I'm looking for new work, which I promised to do when I took the job (they can hate me as much as they want as long I have fulfilled all my personal promises).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He asked if he should join the ongoing retro to see what the problem was, which was most adorable thing I've ever seen a manager say. Ah, to believe that people surface real issues at retros in dysfunctional organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm out looking for better work, which may or may not kill the best of my writing when I get there (whatever that's worth). Only time will tell. If you're in Australia, NZ, or at an organization that would hire someone working from there, reach out to me. Even if you aren't hiring now, I'd love to hear about the work you do if you're vaguely happy, and what it took to get there - ludicity.hackernews@gmail.com. I'll also head back through my inbox and reconnect with anyone that has previously offered to talk to me about work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rest assured I am a reasonably well-adjusted person, or I wouldn't get invited to people's offices and introduced to their CEOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose that's all for now. I feel a great peace washing over me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, if I was the leader of this person's company I would immediately terminate them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is so toxic to work with people who are this entitled. Getting this upset over a mandatory meeting? What a nightmare. You know this is just the tip of the iceberg for their bad behavior if they are the type to publish a seething screed over something so banal.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't like four hour meetings either. But give me a break. Running companies is hard, keeping teams aligned is hard. Sometimes keeping things going requires doing things that we don't like. That's just called being an adult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You stupid son of a bitch. You drooling imbecile. Everyone thinks you're a dickhead, and I'd rather gargle knives than be within eight steps of you on an org chart, let alone work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If I was the leader of this person's company", holy shit, you wish, you fucking sycophant. The termites in your frontal cortex must have burrowed &lt;em&gt;deep&lt;/em&gt; and feasted well to enable you to write this, and it is unsurprising to see that you'd write it on a throwaway account. The dual curse of being both a coward and loser must be unbearable. No one gives two shits what you would do if you ran a company because you're too impotent to even grift your way to the top. You remind me of a guy I knew who screamed at his employees while busily launching his literal eight failed company in a row. He'd sit in his office, flipping between negging interns and gazing wistfully at cars he couldn't afford, sometimes painfully joking-not-joking that he &lt;em&gt;wished&lt;/em&gt; he could buy one. That's you, except you've taken the art form of being a fucking unlikable dipshit to new heights by doing this from the downvoted section of the Hackernews peanut gallery, the only place &lt;em&gt;sadder&lt;/em&gt; than a $0 revenue startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a fucking energy vampire.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/the-violent-role-of-relentless-positivity-in-the-workplace/</guid></item><item><title>Leadership Is A Hell Of A Drug</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/leadership-is-a-hell-of-a-drug/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I received the following invitation to a compulsory on-site meeting, following management's repeated engagements with some sort of Agile shaman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have been invited to:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compulsory On-Site: Continuous Improvement Playback &amp;amp; Strategy  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes:
This will be an all-morning meeting so arrive energized as we hit the ground running on Monday morning  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Leadership Team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh &lt;em&gt;man&lt;/em&gt;, where do I even &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; to make fun of this? There's so much here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, why did you clowns make it a compulsory on-site event? Do you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; think that it was worth dragging everyone into the office against their will because we needed to listen to you talk for four hours in a row? That level of self-regard is narcissistic to such a degree that I have screeched so far past horror that I've looped around to arrive at a grudging respect. I can only imagine this is the equivalent of a meditator achieving perfect concentration on the breath, but instead it is the all-consuming feeling that people like listening to you say the word strategy for &lt;em&gt;four hours&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, do we really need to "be energised" and "hit the ground running" for a goddamn four hour meeting on a Monday.? Are you trying to help me sell cryptocurrency or get involved in a pyramid scheme? Half of us just write SQL for enterprise dashboards that no one reads, you absolute sickos. You don't work at SpaceX - the &lt;em&gt;largest&lt;/em&gt; project we're working on right now is a big spreadsheet that is nonetheless six months behind schedule. &lt;em&gt;Sleeping&lt;/em&gt; is higher energy than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, did you have a stroke and forget how to talk like a human? Continuous Improvement Playback and Strategy? How about "Our plans to improve working conditions for 2024", you fucking weirdos? Does the part of your brain that produces normal speech ossify naturally as part of becoming an enterprise manager, or is that a prerequisite for the job?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourthly, given that half of you love turning up on stages and talking about your decades of leadership experience, why did you need someone from outside the organization who doesn't know a damn thing about our work to come in and tell you how you're screwing up? I'll tell you for free! That is a &lt;em&gt;breathtaking&lt;/em&gt; level of disconnection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, and most importantly, what kind of maniac signs off on something as "The Leadership Team"? That's what we're talking about today - leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i"&gt;I.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've spoken to plenty of people that I'd actually call good leaders in the past year but I strongly hold that theory is no substitute for lived experience. And I've never formally held a position of leadership in an organization. Nonetheless, at some point we must concede you don't have to be a chef to notice that not only is this cake unbaked, it is a slurry of yolk, whites, eggshells, and flour that someone has flung into a bucket and declared finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, leadership is not like baking a cake. There are no yolks, eggshells, or flour. However it occurred to me after writing the above that all of my would-be leaders since getting to Australia have been white despite all the engineers being Asian, so maybe I'm onto something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Whyte's &lt;a href="https://davidwhyte.com/pages/consolations"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consolations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a beautiful book on the quiet re-association of words with all the little connotations they have that fall to the wayside amidst the modern coarsening of them. The blending of &lt;em&gt;leadership&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;management&lt;/em&gt; is one such coarsening that I think needs to be addressed before we continue. They describe radically different things that are merely occasionally carried out by the same person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management is mundane and unsexy, and that's &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt;. Not everything requires a manic Silicon Valley energy. You can roster employees for the next shift at McDonald's with basically none of what we'd call leadership. Just be halfway competent, have a basic understanding of what you're doing, and ensure the thing gets done by the people that are paid to do the thing. The supermarket remains open because of the relatively efficient repetition of this task every day. Calling yourself "The Management Team" is not offensive to my eyes, and while I am certain that the word "management" is deployed in retail stores by petty tyrants across the globe with all the subtlety of a tactical nuclear device, the warning bells do not sound loudly to my ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But leadership, oh &lt;em&gt;baby&lt;/em&gt;, that's what everyone wants to do. Managing is mundane and leadership is exciting. A manager handles trivialities, like hiring and firing. A leader has the privilege of serving as a shining moral beacon, soothing the trouble, reading the psychodynamic eddies (read: vibes) in the organization. At its best, it is a genuinely noble endeavor, not carried out by whoever happens to be at the top of an organizational chart, but whoever has the capacity to encourage other people to be their best selves at a given moment. The most inspiring person in my life yesterday was not anyone that gives talks about how amazing their own skills are, but the seven year old in the house next door who was drilling table tennis so determinedly that I guiltily got some piano practice in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I have &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; experienced anything I'd call leadership from anyone that has called themselves a member of "the leadership team". From my friends, yes. From some serious thinkers, yeah. From "leadership", not even close. Instead, society presents us with an endless parade of people parroting nonsense ranging from the insanely over-excited ("Get shit done! Woo!") to the utterly soulless ("Continuous Improvement Playback &amp;amp; Strategy"). Shut the fuck up! All we do is land the output of APIs in a warehouse, guys. You sound &lt;em&gt;insane&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King: "That's not a luxury, though, coffee and socks are not a luxury."&lt;br&gt;
Pudi: "All right - give me a luxury - what luxury should I have?"&lt;br&gt;
King: "Private plane."&lt;br&gt;
Pudi: "... Larry, I'm on Ducktales."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These people are running some horrific version of leadership that consists entirely of them turning up and repeating the same tired cliches on a loop. Reduce silos. Be more Agile. We must go forward, not backwards. Can you imagine how fucked in the head you'd have to be to imagine you can hold a &lt;em&gt;four hour&lt;/em&gt; unrehearsed session and that you &lt;em&gt;expect it to be so good that you demand everyone be there for it&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something genuinely scary about the idea of people so caught up in their own self-image that they think leadership is turning up on stage to dispense divine corporate manna unto the huddles masses, then expectantly waiting for the choir to raise their voices in sickly-sweet supplication: "That's a great idea, boss."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-thoughtfulness"&gt;II. Thoughtfulness&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most scathing condemnation I have of the majority of people that would call themselves leaders is the fact that... well, most of them don't read, or proudly proclaim that they do most of their study on LinkedIn. I have heard &lt;em&gt;multiple&lt;/em&gt; people say the latter without a hint of shame. And with this, I cannot help but question whether they're bad at technology, or bad at &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of people that unironically call themselves leaders seem to be fighting a constantly losing rearguard action around what their area of competence actually is. Leadership in the absence of a &lt;em&gt;skill&lt;/em&gt; is just aspiring to run a cult of personality. I am assured that while they can't program, they know a lot about running I.T projects. Then all our projects run late, but I am assured they actually know a lot about finance. Then we are unprofitable, but I am assured they know a lot about retaining staff. Then the staff leave, and I have most recently been assured that they are working hard on increasing salaries - that &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be the reason everyone is leaving because it couldn't be that they've lost faith in leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it &lt;em&gt;so easy&lt;/em&gt; for the readers here to assure me that they have actual competence in some domain, but it is impossible for all these dorks? All they would have to do is say &lt;em&gt;one sentence&lt;/em&gt; that indicated some level of original thought - I'm not even hard to trick! There are so many domains that I don't know much about that they could basically string together any insightful-sounding series of syllables and I'd conclude they're smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this: the lawyer I mentioned in &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/on-authenticity-and-whats-worth-doing/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; had opinions on whether statically typed languages are superior to dynamically typed languages, and had engaged in some complex meta-cognition. See, they reflected on how every time they felt that something in Go was ugly, it later turned out that Go was well-designed and they simply didn't understand the issues being designed around. This turned into a rough rule that seeing a problem with Go &lt;em&gt;typically&lt;/em&gt; reflected a flaw in their own understanding, thus &lt;em&gt;flaw with Go&lt;/em&gt; is actually best processed as &lt;em&gt;flaw in own brain&lt;/em&gt; until proven otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know much about Go, but that's not important. What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; important is that I'm on my knees, arms outstretched, gazing up at the sky, tears streaming down my face, and begging to have one question answered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does a practicing lawyer have more thoughts on programming than every CTO I've had a 1:1 with at a big company?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-ego"&gt;III. Ego&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone doesn't have the ability to award someone else status or money, they're told they're a good &lt;em&gt;manager&lt;/em&gt;. This is usually a person whose job it is to hover in the air, screaming, while the organization channels all their dysfunction like bolts of Atlassian-branded lightning into their twitching, smoking mortal coil. This hopefully gives the people beneath them time to actually do their jobs uninterrupted for up to ten seconds. When that person burns out, you discard their charcoal corpse, slap in a new one, and set the machine going once again. That job is horrible and we all thank you for your service, you glorious bastards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if a person &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; provide someone status or money, they will be told that they're a great &lt;em&gt;leader&lt;/em&gt;, and by the way, I heard that there might a role opening up on that new prestigious project and I'd like to throw my hat in the ring. Being called a leader shoots an LD50 dose of status-infused dopamine directly into the average person's system, and this is absolutely exploited to the hilt by every grifter under the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only imagine that this is extremely corrosive for your development as a person, but it is also &lt;em&gt;dreadfully obvious&lt;/em&gt; when it happens. A few years ago, I had dinner with a guy in his early twenties who had a very successful non-profit take off. He was very seriously despairing at how many events he was being invited to where people would fawn over him despite the fact he was twenty-one. I believe his exact words were a very sarcastic "Society isn't broken at all!" with a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; distressed look on his face. If a twenty-one year old could figure out that adulation is unhealthy, what's everyone else's excuse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is tragic to see how easy it is to push the ego button on some people. Someone once wrote in and referred to LinkedIn as the "clout factory", and it is hard not to think about almost all non-athletic awards in this way. These processes become so easily corrupted that I think the most impressive thing a person can do is reject all awards on the principle that they're bad for you spiritually. I'll leave it to the reader to decide how prescient this is, but Taleb wrote the following in 2007, which I think those Americans among you will appreciate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor did the committee come to us practitioners to ask us our opinions; instead it relied on an academic vetting process that, in some disciplines, can be corrupt all the way to the marrow. After that award I made a prediction: "In a world in which these two get the Nobel, anything can happen. Anyone can become president."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the Agile consultant I mentioned above has done &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; to flatter the leadership team, though the specifics are invisible to the rest of us. It might have been as simple as calling them &lt;em&gt;leadership&lt;/em&gt; a lot, and the consultant might genuinely be unaware that this is the secret to their success. After flattering leadership for a while, they arranged some group sessions with the teams and &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt; blundered away all their reputation, with such brilliant questions as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Rate how well you think you understand our strategy going into 2024? We know leadership hasn't put out a strategy yet." Well, this question doesn't make any fucking sense then, does it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Rate how well-trained you are at Agile, on a scale of 1 - 5?" Firstly, what the hell does this even mean? Do you mean Scrum? Secondly, someone said 2 and the Agile folks rounded his answer up to 3 for no discernible reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only conclude that, behind the scenes, they had spent the past few weeks just telling management whatever they wanted to hear, and didn't think the peasants were smart enough to feel patronized by all this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-doing-better"&gt;IV. Doing Better&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id="management-again"&gt;Management, Again&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;em&gt;manager&lt;/em&gt; I've ever worked for was Healthscope's Dave Coulter, who has been mentioned previously &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/fury-driven-development/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The only reason I say &lt;em&gt;manager&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;leader&lt;/em&gt; is that we worked in an organization that was fundamentally disempowering, so we spent most of our time trying the conventional corporate wisdom of "educating our stakeholders", which did not work, I've never seen work, and I've never met someone that has seen it cause &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; organizational transformation. But he did the hard work, knew the tools, &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt;, and took care of the team. It was &lt;em&gt;really simple&lt;/em&gt;, and I learned that there's no real trick to this. Use your brain and your empathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also he &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; in an organizationally-sanctioned leadership role now, but has never called himself a "leader" &lt;em&gt;because that would indicate fucking madness&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="leadership-again"&gt;Leadership, Again&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;em&gt;leader&lt;/em&gt; I've ever worked for was, to everyone's surprise including my own, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-deutsch-au"&gt;Stephen Deutsch&lt;/a&gt; in the state government (the surprise is because the government is genuinely pretty bad at most things). I was burned out on tech work by the time I got to him, and I remember &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; enjoying working with him. We were in the fire service, which occupies a place of huge civic importance in the Australian psyche, and he would turn up and be absolutely honest every single day. Right as the latent burnout from my previous role reached a crescendo, I told him I intended to leave for a place that was offering me three days of work a week so I could do some recovering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of a call, he commiserated, shared his own struggles with me, and then &lt;em&gt;completely unilaterally disarmed&lt;/em&gt;. He got me an offer to work there for three days a week, explained that it would never be as stable as taking a permanent role doing the same elsewhere, further explained that I currently had a lot of power due to the way their budget and projects were set up, and otherwise completely collapsed his own negotiating position so that I would have the tools to take care of myself. It made his life substantially harder in exchange for making mine much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up leaving, and he made the decision to leave easier, yes. But we stayed in touch because you don't run into people like that every day. He's a co-director with me now, I play board games with his friends every week, and that disarmament was so radical that I still think "J'ds hasfak 'ds'" every time it comes up, which I dare everyone to recognize without looking up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="getting-involved-myself"&gt;Getting Involved Myself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've considered getting into a leadership role myself to see what it's really like, but this is complicated by a few things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is that I don't think leadership roles should really exist in many domains, as I've indicated earlier. Leadership should naturally flow between team members based on the task being performed, competence of each member, and psychodynamic energy (read again: vibes) on any given day. Taking a role as a team lead somewhere sounds almost paradoxical - the whole goal would be to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; behave as a team lead, which is clearly not how the organization functions or they wouldn't have a role called team lead. I can certainly &lt;em&gt;imagine&lt;/em&gt; a version of a team lead that encourages a healthy culture, but this would run counter to the true values of most companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second issue is that I think I'd be good at it, which strikes me as a huge CAUTION! sign. Everyone knows what I mean, and everyone must also concede that this is also a sign of how dire the situation is out in the real world. When I tell my teammates that I think I can design a simple application, their first thought is (hopefully) not "Wow, he must be about to fucking &lt;em&gt;bomb&lt;/em&gt; this!". When I tell &lt;em&gt;myself&lt;/em&gt; that I think I could do a decent job managing two juniors, my first thought is "I might be a sociopath". The people that consistently rate as the most insane authority figures I've seen over the past few years have been the ones that said "I'm a natural leader" during the interview process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is also incredibly common for people to remark that those most suited for "leadership" roles are those that don't &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; leadership roles. I think that protects from the worst excesses of getting a narcissist in charge, but doesn't actually consistently produce &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; leadership. I asked Stephen about this, and he happily said that he loves leadership roles (and I can confirm that I never felt like a subordinate working with him). Simultaneously, one of the most senior people in my current reporting chain is a great person that was forced to take up leadership despite promises that they wouldn't have to. Haven't seen them in months. Great person, lots of respect for them, sadly absolutely useless to me. I don't think they'd even disagree with that assessment, they'd just feel guilty. So I guess that whole line of thought belongs in the dumpster if you want to pursue human flourishing rather than limp sustainably onward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is still something I'm mulling over, but I reckon it's best not to force it by explicitly looking for a role in the space. It'll happen organically or it won't, and there's no point doing it at mediocre organizations. Instead, I thought it would be nice to share some reading and my thoughts on doing it right before wrapping up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="some-reading"&gt;Some Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've mentioned &lt;em&gt;High Output Management&lt;/em&gt; before, and I think this is really the quintessential book on management devoid of leadership (and that's not a bad thing). It's full of nothing other than guidance on how to manage operations smoothly and not screw up your meetings. Can't go wrong with it, even though everyone has qualms with some part or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been enjoying &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Managing-Humans-Humorous-Software-Engineering/dp/1430243147"&gt;Managing Humans&lt;/a&gt; but something that really bothers me is... well, the environments described in it are accurate, but they also suck. There's a huge amount of stuff in it about managing rumors, organizational politics, and so on. All the ugliness is baked right in. It's probably the perfect book for someone that wants to do a good job at a huge company that has no real chance for reaching the Nirvana of everyone being high-performing and psychologically comfortable - and that's fine, some of us have to work at those places, but I know the readers &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt; don't want to, so there's limited long-term utility to developing those skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pivotal-software"&gt;Pivotal Software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I've &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; been into these days has been covering some of the original Extreme Programming material and, more uniquely, talking with some of the people that used to work down in Pivotal Software. There's a lot to write about this, but I had a three-hour long conversation with &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessetalford/"&gt;Jesse Alford&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago, and was immediately intrigued by what the experience of working there sounded like. Jesse himself was brilliant, but there's also a lot of material on their functioning that I had never heard of before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their alumni community is some sort of cult where they're all chasing the high of working at an organization that good again. There's a &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/radio-free-xp/id1707924562"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to spreading some of their operating model out there, hosted by alumni with plenty of other alumni coming on as guests. Every single episode slaps and has leadership wisdom that makes most other sources seem tragically oversimplified. Here's &lt;a href="https://www.simplermachines.com/mr-reciprocity/"&gt;a big essay&lt;/a&gt; on what made working there so special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hell, I read a book called &lt;a href="https://davidmarquet.com/turn-the-ship-around-book/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turn The Ship Around!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; enjoyed on leadership - I dare say it was the best book on the topic I've ever read, or at least as good as a leadership book can possibly get. I wrote up a whole post on it, really thought about it, then realized that I wasn't comfortable publishing it because I didn't have enough experience &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the author does management consulting now, which I thoroughly distrust. Lo and behold, here is the author &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/nudge-61-with-david-marquet/id1707924562?i=1000633646689"&gt;on their podcast&lt;/a&gt;, with admittedly terrible microphone quality, making statements that are socially expensive enough about the median employer for me to be willing to endorse his book. I can't recommend the book and the episode highly enough, in that order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm hoping to spend the next few weeks getting deep into the Pivotal lore/cult and figuring out what worked so well for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v"&gt;V.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stare at the invitation for a long moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is from someone in the C-suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;ensure&lt;/em&gt; that my response is going to be sent to the organizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I click decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one remarks on my absence, and I receive only these messages from the attending engineers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm bored of hearing the word strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone just turned around and asked me "Wtf are they saying?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are suggesting dumb shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world has gone mad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leadership is a hell of a drug.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/leadership-is-a-hell-of-a-drug/</guid></item><item><title>Flexible Schemas Are The Mindkiller</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/flexible-schemas-are-the-mindkiller/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;We need to talk about the kind of person that loves "flexible" schemas, and why I am unable to disclose what I will do the next time I see one without going on a watch list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i"&gt;I.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I worked at a company that had received $1M from FAANG (that's Facebook et. al. for the one art historian who reads this blog) to produce an AI and data classification tool. For some of you super slick operators out there in your diamond-clad superstructures, where Kubernetes is a real thing, the phrase "web-scale" doesn't make you assume your interlocutor is a moron, and you spend your days rightfully leering down at the little ants scurrying around from on high, this might seem like a very small amount of money. For this organization, $1M was the &lt;em&gt;largest&lt;/em&gt; sum of money they had ever received - it immediately went on everyone's CV. Of course, only like three people were working on it, but everyone took credit nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without going into details, this was also the only AI product I've seen at a company I've actually worked at with clear, unambiguous goals that were almost certainly achievable due to the volume of valuable data they had. And to top it off, it had &lt;em&gt;actual positive societal outcomes&lt;/em&gt;. I was one of the two data scientists, joining the project at a late stage because it had been "lagging a bit". The experienced engineers are already upset. I believe it was in &lt;em&gt;The Mythical Man Month&lt;/em&gt; that I read a project should "allow no small slippages" - something is either going to be on time or &lt;em&gt;considerably&lt;/em&gt; delayed, although evidently we still haven't learned from a book written in 1975.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the other data scientist was a very close friend, and now co-director at our own company, so I knew that things would be in good shape on the AI end of things. They just needed a hand getting some projects across the line, maybe someone to pair program with. The models were basically already working by the time I joined, so all that was left was to check in on the last member of the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fucking Derek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-that-absolute-son-of-a-bitch"&gt;II. That Absolute Son Of A Bitch&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; things that needed to be done. The first was the AI stuff (we used BERT encoding and did some deep learning for those interested, but it could have been a random forest, like almost everything). Donezo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; thing was very simple. The organization had many staff dedicated to data labeling using a series of Access databases. Put simply, it's a database that non-technical staff can use like a spreadsheet for data entry, without all the chaos of untrained people creating your organization's data models for the rest of eternity. Despite the good things spreadsheets enable, please take a moment to reflect on &lt;em&gt;whether they are actually worth the tradeoff&lt;/em&gt; in light of that sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organization wanted to replace that Access interface with a simple web application so that some functionality could be added, and new data could be pre-labelled by our machine learning work. To do so, they hired Derek, so named because I &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/your-organization-probably-doesnt-want-to-improve-things/"&gt;evidently decided that Derek is our default name for someone that hurts me&lt;/a&gt;. Sorry, Dereks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derek had &lt;em&gt;one simple job&lt;/em&gt;. Make a &lt;em&gt;really easy&lt;/em&gt; CRUD app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a simple authentication system. Replicate seven CRUD pages. Create a SQL Server instance to store the data instead of Access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had been working on it for eight months before I joined, and was scheduled to leave three days after I joined. However, the application was "basically finished" according to management, and Derek had received glowing praise for his extreme efficiency and quiet work ethic. He had also come highly recommended. On the very first day, he is asked to make an adjustment to the application, and he does so in five minutes. He very proudly says this is because the application is "very flexible". &lt;strong&gt;I could have saved myself so much pain if I had run at this second.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, since my friend was quite inexperienced at running engineering projects (and I was too, but had some natural aptitude I guess), I decided to make sure the handover was graceful. I asked Derek to share his repository with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of this story is one train crashing in slow motion, and it has not actually stopped crashing four years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-it-all-goes-wrong"&gt;III. It All Goes Wrong&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the code was version controlled. He had been working for &lt;em&gt;eight months&lt;/em&gt; and there was not a single commit in sight. It was all just a gigantic pile of files on his computer, and it was all undocumented and uncommented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I meander away, stunned. I return five minutes later and ask him to just put the whole dump of files in a repository and write up a quick word document explaining how to run the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derek does as asked. The documentation is admittedly adequate. That is the last positive thing that will be said of Derek. He departs soon thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv"&gt;IV.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a month later and... the app doesn't work. It takes us a while to figure out how to launch it, and when we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; launch it, we realize that the core functionality simply doesn't work. Derek had put together a series of pages that &lt;em&gt;looked&lt;/em&gt; like they worked to a manager that only investigated for thirty seconds over his shoulder, but they didn't function as intended. Some minor features were missing. For example, it had some small flaws such as &lt;em&gt;never saving any user input&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To complicate things further, the whole server was written in C# so bad that I was put off the language for two years until being reassured by competent people that .NET is actually okay, and the frontend was done with Angular so ugly that I &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; think it must suck. It was, of course, a single-page application for no fucking reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, okay, let's see if we can salvage this. My friend and I start unspooling the mess. The records are being pulled from, uh, &lt;em&gt;one table&lt;/em&gt;? Wait, what? We have hundreds of columns across those seven pages. The whole database is one table? The whole database is one table. The whole database is &lt;em&gt;one table&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did he &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Bill Karwin's extremely good book, &lt;em&gt;SQL Antipatterns&lt;/em&gt;, which I unfortunately only read a year later:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you hear phrases like the following spoken by your project team, it’s a clue that someone is employing the EAV antipattern:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• “This database is totally extensible without metadata changes. You can define new attributes at runtime.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relational databases don’t support that degree of flexibility. When someone claims to have designed an arbitrarily extensible database, they’re probably using the EAV design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had stored &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; as key-value pairs. So instead of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=""&gt;User&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=""&gt;Age&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=""&gt;Profession&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=""&gt;Ludic&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=""&gt;29&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=""&gt;Tortured Soul&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=""&gt;User ID&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=""&gt;Key&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=""&gt;Value&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=""&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=""&gt;Name&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=""&gt;Ludic&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=""&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=""&gt;Age&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=""&gt;29&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=""&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=""&gt;Profession&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=""&gt;Tortured Soul&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each individual case to be labelled had 350 rows of data now, in one &lt;em&gt;super long&lt;/em&gt; table. Remember how I said this was actually a reasonable AI project? Yeah, we had a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of data, now multiplied by 350 and a fucking nightmare to query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opt to proceed by redoing the entire database. It takes &lt;em&gt;a while&lt;/em&gt;. Then we rework the Angular app (also &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; painful) to work with the new (correct) data model. The decision to just do the right thing here instead of limping on forever gave us &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; speed benefits later on, and I think it's one of my proudest professional accomplishments even though it sounds simple. It was boring, painful, and no one other than my friend would ever appreciate it. I &lt;em&gt;knew that&lt;/em&gt; going in, and I still did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, I was allowed to do so only because management had been so negligent in allowing things to get to this state that they also didn't notice I was getting them out of this state, and thus couldn't insert their asinine opinions on how good practice is actually too slow. We've got to &lt;em&gt;ship&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v"&gt;V.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, you thought this was over? No, no, you see, the flexible schema is simply a portent of things to come. It is the blood moon hanging low in the sky, a malevolent eye bleeding crimson despair across the landscape. It is the sickly glint of a ravenous knife in a dark alleyway. Wielded by the uninitiated, it is a sign that you must flee, flee as fast as your legs can carry you, and I was too foolish to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each morning, I'm one of the few people that takes the time to get to know the data entry team, and it is becoming increasingly clear that they are treated by management as not-quite-real-people. Useful, to be treated with cordiality, but certainly not to be invited out for morning coffee. The &lt;em&gt;core&lt;/em&gt; functionality is brought into a state where I know we can deliver on time, and I cheerfully mention this right before lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Oh, amazing, can we see it? We've been waiting years."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... &lt;em&gt;Years&lt;/em&gt;? We only got the $1M about nine months ago. Development hadn't started. How long has management been promising this app to these people? I didn't really have time to look for these signs of dysfunction when I joined because of my visa status &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; not knowing what to look for those days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wait&lt;/em&gt;. No one &lt;em&gt;had shown the staff the application in ten months&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it turns out they just showed Derek the Access database and said "Could you turn this into an app?". And then they didn't talk to him for eight months or do anything remotely close to requirements gathering. Just let one guy that didn't know anything about the company's operations just start designing the software that would underpin the entirety of their operations. Cool. Cool, cool, cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I show the staff the application, and I think they're more thrilled that someone has actually included them than they are at the application. We make some tweaks because it is immediately apparently that it still has major flaws. This takes a bunch of time too, and I am &lt;em&gt;tired&lt;/em&gt;. This is all happening amidst the middle of Covid, so I am periodically being forced to spend weeks locked in my apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vi"&gt;VI.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is around 11 AM, about a week later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am working on a schema migration. I look at one of the Access databases that Derek had been populating his local SQL Server instance with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very abruptly, my blood runs ice-cold, something I had only experienced &lt;em&gt;once&lt;/em&gt; before when I endured the rite-of-passage of my first production mistake. I have no idea how this hadn't occurred to me until this second, seven months after Derek left, but suddenly the right two neurons fire. My blood is running cold &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; just thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had copied one of the Access databases onto his local machine. An Access database full of &lt;em&gt;extremely sensitive&lt;/em&gt; medical data. Like "I have never heard of a leaked dataset that would be this damaging to vulnerable people" levels of sensitive. And I have a copy. Which means &lt;em&gt;Derek put it on GitHub&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a voice playing in my head since that moment. It has become very quiet, and I had almost forgotten about it, but I can hear it now. It sounds like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just take a little bit to soak in the horror for a bit. I'll wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, we're done panicking together. Let's move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repository is, thankfully, set to private. Which of course, doesn't change the fact the fact a fuckton of absolutely radioactive data had just been uploaded to a third-party's servers outside of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We handle it very judiciously. I can't even remember how it was raised or what the decision was, but this was out of my hands as a lowly brown person on a very tenuous visa. It would be wrong to say it blew over because management finessed it such that there was nary a whisper of any wrongdoing. I am pretty sure it all worked out fine, truth be told - at this point I suspect all the backups containing the breach have expired, and we hit the actual file with the &lt;a href="https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/"&gt;BFG&lt;/a&gt; and then ran all sorts of things on our hard drives to ensure that the data wouldn't be recoverable even by specialists. Enterprise infosec isn't a fake circus moon though, am I right fellow executives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also &lt;em&gt;just realized&lt;/em&gt; that he might have been working on a personal laptop. That we wouldn't have scrubbed clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to take another moment to calm down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vii"&gt;VII.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a week later. I am deep in horrific depths of some helper function Derek wrote to produce some of SQL Server tables. There is a comprehensive docstring at the top of the file, which is very unlike Derek. Maybe he isn't so bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COPYRIGHT MEDTECH, 2015.&lt;br&gt;
Author: Derek&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That... isn't where I work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stare at the screen for a few minutes, pondering what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I close the file and move on. Just... just... yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="viii"&gt;VIII.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, management announces that remote work is cancelled, and we need to be in three days a week because it will aid collaboration. Our addle-brained senior manager, who has no idea what's happening but also put that $1M on their CV, keeps forgetting whether they're usually honest with me or not. Each day, they flip a coin and decide whether they're going to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am so excited to come back to the office! It'll be great to see some people around again, great for productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate this, but the executives are making us do it. God, I would prefer to be spending time with my grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the air conditioning in the office doesn't work very well, and I have suddenly remembered that I enjoy not being in a dimly lit room at 27 degrees Celsius (80.6 degrees Fahrenheit for you whacky Americans) for eight hours a day surrounded by lizard people. By sheer luck, my permanent residency is approved after years of struggle. I quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important person in the organization calls me to yell because they made me promise to stay in order to not get deported a while ago. Sometimes I think about their impotent fury paired with the flaccid repetition of "I just thought you were a man of your word but I can see I was mistaken" and smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, I would be livid that I did &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; to help them. But firstly, I was well-paid. Secondly, the other engineer quits too within two months. One of my current clients, doing lifesaving work that my team agreed to help pro-bono (and I'm so proud of them for it), is in the periphery of that project. They confirmed recently that it still hasn't launched despite there being only a year of work (&lt;em&gt;extreme&lt;/em&gt; upper bound estimate) left to launch at the time I left for two competent engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perish&lt;/em&gt;, nerds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ix"&gt;IX.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.” - Linus Torvalds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the programmers that do neither?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not know what it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; about flexible schemas, but there is a certain type of person that probably has all the mental horsepower required to be a &lt;em&gt;phenomenal&lt;/em&gt; engineer that simply gets stuck on their "elegance" and then never progresses any further. The fact that Derek had the working memory and patience to whip this grotesque Angular/.NET/schemaless abomination into something that even ran at all indicates he has a level of pain tolerance and raw brainstuff that I cannot even approach. I &lt;em&gt;can't handle&lt;/em&gt; things that badly designed, and it isn't just aesthetic sense or design intuition. The hardware in my skull isn't up to spec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I just &lt;em&gt;keep meeting that person&lt;/em&gt;. The first sign I'm dealing with an Idiot-Pattern clone is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; "I've found a way to not worry about our data model, ha ha", and always ends with "I have single-handedly destroyed the infrastructure of this company". Also, you can never fire them because there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a schema, it lives in their incomprehensible code and in their brains. The worst part is that they're &lt;em&gt;always so proud&lt;/em&gt; of the flexibility, as if they're the first fucking genius to realize that if you discard things like, I dunno, database types and queryability and any sort of validation, then you can code "without interruption" whatever that means. Then they exhibit this lack of judgement in every other area of their professional lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; understand how they are both smarter than me in many respects, and then &lt;em&gt;still don't understand how stupid this all is&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="x"&gt;X.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is years later. I am brought onto a platform that is advertised as state-of-the-art. Every competitor in the state is copying our implementation. On my first day, they tell me that all ETL metadata and logging is stored in DynamoDB because it is more flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first clue that they were idling their computers &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-accidentally-saved-half-a-million-dollars/"&gt;to the tune of half a million dollars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="_1"&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: You can stop reading here, the post is over. The rest of this is about setting up Liberapay and Patreon to receive support for writing/podcasting/whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preferred option is &lt;a href="https://en.liberapay.com/Ludic/"&gt;Liberapay&lt;/a&gt; because it is open-source and aligned with the principles of this community. However &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/ludic190/membership"&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt; is also available in case you already have an account and just want to click the buttons fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons for this are written in &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/on-authenticity-and-whats-worth-doing/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;. However, you will probably get my writing forever, for free. The "probably" is not because I'd start charging, but because life might get in the way at times, and there might be breaks in my output. And the currently-being-recorded podcast will also probably be free forever, though this might actually have some paywalled episodes one day if it is time-consuming enough - editing audio doesn't sound as fun as writing. But of course, even then I'm promising right now, with God as my witness, that I'd hand it out for free to anyone that can't justify the expense because I have something called &lt;em&gt;ethics&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;bad business sense&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, you will receive no benefits other than showing appreciation, covering the cost of extending my weekly music classes from 30 minutes to 45 minutes, and eventually paying for hosting a cheap server or two that I'll use to deploy some stuff to help coordinate our community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both systems are configured to show how much I'm getting even though this is demonstrably &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; for your income, because I am evidently hellbent on only accepting money from &lt;em&gt;very insistent&lt;/em&gt; people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am only going to add this footnote to a post once every six months (this must be done or no new readers will ever know the links are there). And then I won't have to mar too many posts with this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/flexible-schemas-are-the-mindkiller/</guid></item><item><title>On Authenticity And What's Worth Doing</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/on-authenticity-and-whats-worth-doing/</link><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told&lt;br&gt;
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles&lt;br&gt;
Such are promises&lt;br&gt;
All lies and jest&lt;br&gt;
Still a man hears what he wants to hear&lt;br&gt;
And disregards the rest  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i"&gt;I.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm somewhat frequently asked how I write. Here's the secret - I sit down and write, write until my fingers cramp, until my back aches from focus eroding my posture, until I have nothing left to say, and that's that. If there's anything secret, it's that there is no secret - every word I write is simple Markdown into a fairly ugly text box. Get rid of everything extraneous, including the voice in your head that says it isn't good enough, and then you can write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Picture of the ugly Mataroa editor" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/d5808bd1.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past few weeks, I've been overflowing with ideas for things I want to write about - but nothing felt right when I sat down to type. My mind would inevitably stray to a titled but blank post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Comes Next?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 27th of February, 2023, I was recovering from severe burnout  having found myself slowly ground down by spending all of my daylight hours in open floor offices replete with harsh lighting and executives (who kept private offices for themselves) and on trains. My time was filled with shuffling Jira cards around on a board to desperately contort hideous systems into deliverables for distant people hiding behind rictus grins of false positivity. Many seem to have no problem with this, and go so far as to say my problems are irrational - you work to survive and it isn't &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be fulfilling - but something about the situation was unbearable. Each time some venom-teared jester asked me to make another sacrifice of Care at the altar of Business, leaden tongues soiling words such as "innovation" and "vision", something vital would slip an inch at a time. I &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/most-data-work-seems-fundamentally-worthless/"&gt;ranted about it&lt;/a&gt; and now we're here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt; is - well, that's unclear. I have a vague notion that a few thousand people read the blog regularly. A few thousand intelligent, competent, empathic people taking the time to read long-form content is, I suspect, a lot more meaningful than getting a million hits on TikTok, which I am convinced is giving me a lot of job security via rotting the next generation's brains. And while the community is near invisible (it exists in my inbox - no forum, no Discord server, I don't even turn comments on here), I assure you that we do nonetheless have a community. If someone needs help, it is available. I've had a close friend employed through this blog, and have had 300 or so people write in to vent or say that a post resonated. I could write essays every day for the next two months with nothing but the best quotes as inspiration. I've received a lot of help with my business, had sincere conversations with great people, and I've been working very hard to pay things forward. Didn't get any hatemail though, which &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/compliments/"&gt;I'm a little bit sad about&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I haven't been able to write because I've been stuck figuring out what to do next. Deanonymize immediately? Partially? Start a podcast? Tour the U.S? Get on the speaking circuit? Who am I to do any of those? &lt;em&gt;What comes next?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then this morning, I woke up to a short message. At my very first job, I worked with a man named Asyraf. At the time, he seemed very old, wizened, and serious - but of course, he would have merely been in his early 30s or late 20s, and I was just very young. I wish I had stayed in touch with him, but all I can say is that he was a very pleasant man, who had clearly not grown up with the sheer luck I've had, but nonetheless had infinite kindness and compassion for a surgeon's son with an inexplicably Western accent in Malaysia. He passed away last Sunday. Likely heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'm here writing, a year and a day from the start by coincidence (mythic!), because I don't think that I've got enough time to delay or be timid. And I'm not going to worry about &lt;em&gt;"what comes next?"&lt;/em&gt;, but instead, &lt;em&gt;"what's worth doing?"&lt;/em&gt;. Below are my thoughts, next steps, and all are open to feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii"&gt;II.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might seem from my writing that I'm fueled entirely by a blinding hatred for corporate insincerity. In actual fact, I'm filled with an entirely aware hatred of the hideous things our systems do to people, which is more general. I am out of patience, and have been for some time. More importantly, I suspect the patience is never coming back. Behold the field in which I grow my fucks. Lay thine eyes upon it and thou shalt see that it is barren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only things I see that are worth doing are those things that are absolutely necessary to live, that make life worth living, and that help others. Each time my writing resonates with someone or helps them, I am incredibly happy... and unexpectedly, I think that just makes me &lt;em&gt;more aggressive&lt;/em&gt; in my denunciations instead of calmer. I expected the abatement of cynicism to bank the flames of rage, but some dangerous (to me) part of me thinks, "Why stop when it's working?".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have to compromise to live - I'm confident I can pay my rent even if I get fired. I have the gene that lets you earn money solo in &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; the right quantity to stop immediately short of being a monster. Symptoms include my friends consistently rating me as Lawful Evil, the youngest kids in my family saying that I am Disney's Jaffar, and my girlfriend saying that I am the antagonist of Wish when I took her to Melbourne's Moonlight Cinema, down to the facial hair and maniacal ranting about ungrateful people. I'm not entirely sure if the latter two are because I'm that evil-adjacent or because Disney doesn't make enough brown characters, but &lt;em&gt;I'll take it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="An extremely evil looking Disney villain" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/6d6d93e3.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for life being worth living - I clock out at 5PM sharp these days, and it's up to me to make the best of things outside of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So all that's left is &lt;em&gt;how can I help people?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-authenticity"&gt;III. Authenticity&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I left my home and my family&lt;br&gt;
I was no more than a boy&lt;br&gt;
In the company of strangers&lt;br&gt;
In the quiet of the railway station&lt;br&gt;
Runnin' scared, laying low&lt;br&gt;
Seeking out the poorer quarters, where the ragged people go&lt;br&gt;
Looking for the places only they would know&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke to a reader in the city recently - a professional lawyer who nonetheless expressed sufficiently advanced opinions on writing Go for me to conclude that they're &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; a competent software engineer, which is pretty embarrassing for the rest of us. They had many interesting things to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first was "I think the risks you run over not being anonymous are low. By the way, this isn't legal advice". Which, of course, means it must be great legal advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second was that authenticity is actually valuable, even though the common wisdom is that it's &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; for your career. This deserves a few caveats - your authentic self should probably not be a dickhead, and you also need to understand who you're communicating with because not everyone is a well-meaning agent. The world would be a lot better if people were comfortable being authentic, and speaking out against things that are wrong... but people also have children and mortgages. There's nothing unreasonable about wanting some safety net for your loved ones before opening your mouth to say "Hey, what if this Scrum implementation is all bullshit? And why is the emperor wearing no clothes?".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get a lot of emails from people who are quietly miserable at work and need to break out of the rut they're in. Life is far, far too short to do anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to start off with, I would really like to find a way for readers here to find and support each other. The way that we do this at the moment is... uh... hundreds of people email me, then when someone asks for help, I try to remember who lives in their area. This has miraculously worked so far but is also fucking dumb. But I'm not going to set up a Discord server or forum because I don't have time to moderate it - I try not to be a big baby about it, but I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; trying to run a business on the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One friend suggested a simple online registry where readers can flag the city they live in, their interests, and some system for them getting in touch with each other. There are probably enough readers in Berlin and NYC alone to begin arranging meetups if you're so inclined - every person that has reached out to me has been sane, talented, and I dare say charismatic. Then instead of emailing me for a connection (though you can always do that), you can email me for a code to register and look up people in your area. Or just get coffee with a cool person that I've vetted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one major issue with this. You will have to use software that I've written, which is going to be very embarrassing for me and very painful for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pros are that we will not be a network that relies entirely on my neurons firing in the correct patterns, and I might finally get some hatemail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have very much hope that we're going to change  The Industry writ large. It has been captured by bad incentives and is dominated by the fact that communication is a genuinely hard problem. Smarter people than me have tried to "fix the government" so I'm not tilting at that windmill. But I do &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; believe that we can create something that will at least take care of everyone in our small community, through a mix of helping us find work at big corporations when that is available, and gradually helping everyone move towards whatever their dreams are. For a lot of readers, that's simply "Make a SaaS that doesn't suck, helps people, then relax". &lt;em&gt;Surely&lt;/em&gt; a world where sensible, small companies produce enough revenue to keep their fellow travelers consistently employed is possible. Seize the means of production, not by guillotine, but by building better systems than the empty suits and learning how to do sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had it up to fucking &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt; watching people live in fear of inexorable death machines deciding that they need to juice their profits because they spent all the money on Deloitte. And I have infinite patience for people wanting to vent and seeking help, but I'm sick of not being able to help them immediately and unambiguously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that sounds a bit of an extreme hope, but I have another story about life being too short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in my third year of my psychology degree, I took a business elective to score easy marks while I focused on maximizing my odds of entry into a very competitive clinical course. Somewhere around the middle of that unit, circa 2015, I met a kid named Daniel - though I must confess my memory is fuzzy, and it was perhaps James. We only spoke one time, where it turned out that he was planning to visit my hometown over the break. We &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; got along, and by the end of that thirty minute conversation, I had offered to introduce him to a bunch of people and possibly arrange a place to stay with my family. He was excitedly telling me about a trip he was taking to New Zealand over the mid-semester break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next week, our tutor was waiting solemnly outside the classroom door. A student had passed away on a trip to New Zealand. Class was cancelled. Daniel and his friend James had &lt;a href="https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/monash-university-student-james-murphy-died-after-he-went-back-to-save-friend-kayaking-at-lake-tekapo-20150929-gjx99o.html"&gt;died in a kayaking incident&lt;/a&gt;, with one of them dying in a rescue attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of that, I don't really see what my excuse is for &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; taking a big swing at actually changing many lives for the better. Getting forced to work at McDonald's for a bit because I said the word "fuck" one time too many on the internet? It would be disrespectful to let that stop me for a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-deanonymizing"&gt;IV. Deanonymizing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have received Not Legal Advice that it is totally and unambiguously safe to reveal who I am, right here, and that the lawyer in question has accepted all the legal consequences of that advice being bad... I still can't do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I basically tell anyone who emails me straight away these days, so it doesn't mean that much. The only real benefit at the moment is that this blog doesn't turn up when my real name is Googled, which is a tiny benefit at best. But there are no takebacks, and so there's no immediate rush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more importantly, I thought of a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; funny way to do it, and it also requires some programming time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v-podcasting"&gt;V. Podcasting&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've finished setting up everything I need to create a vaguely listenable podcast, and will begin recording in the next two weeks. The list of guests are largely friends and readers, though I am very interested in getting David Marquet on if possible. While writing is fine as a medium, I have great conversations with people, and it seems a shame that I'm forced to write so many posts on one simple theme at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also been invited to two podcasts, but I don't want to name them so that they can change their minds after listening to me talk without receiving their own hatemail. I've been in Australia for a long time, and swear like it. I used to be so respectable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vi-selling-out"&gt;VI. Selling Out&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, the thing I've struggled with the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was (and am) still incredibly paranoid that money somehow corrupts everything as beautiful and pure as this platform irrevocably. In my head, you take money and then you somehow end up selling testosterone pills to crypto-fascist idiots. In retrospect, this was absurd puritanism because I don't see any possible pathway from "doesn't like Scrum" to "MAGA". Plus in conversations with readers, literally no one has cared at all, even though in my head it was some major ethical commitment. They just want to make sure that I don't do something &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; corrosive like running ads or selling email addresses, which you'd have to fucking &lt;em&gt;torture&lt;/em&gt; me to make me do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has also quickly become apparent that there is no way that I can &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; isolate myself from financial gains through my blog, though it wasn't for a lack of trying. I had a wild dream that my company could serve as a blueprint for anyone else hoping to have a gradual off-ramp from a day job into being self-employed. Which, you know, means that the first step can't be "Be #1 on Hackernews twice" because that's simply not replicable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had a handful of people express interest in keeping me employed if something goes wrong at my day job, which... well, I actually &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; that support but in retrospect, that's immediately financial gain, right? Each expression of serious support in the event of unemployment probably has E(V) = $100,000 which alters my behavior, even if I never take it. Yes, I am the type of person that actually ballparks my finances in E(V), which makes me simultaneously very effective in some situations, and extremely weird in all situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, my company's website has gone from 0 hits a day to 20, which is probably going to shoot up to a few thousand because it isn't very hard to find me &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; we have quite a bit of writing that's about to come out there over the next few months. It's the same as the writing here, but aimed at drumming up some business and giving disgruntled people a source of common-sense that looks authoritative during meetings, which means the Venn diagram of the readership there and here is going to be a perfect circle no matter what I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the time investment of writing (and shortly podcasting) is becoming difficult because I'm starting to behave more responsibly with my writing hours for the sake of my relationship. I &lt;em&gt;strictly&lt;/em&gt; only write between 6AM and 5PM on weekdays, and won't do any over weekends. Plus, you know, I'm trying to run a business during those same hours. So all my writing now cuts into business time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, the same lawyer I mentioned above noted that there's a lot to say for the fact that &lt;em&gt;transparently&lt;/em&gt; knowing where money comes from builds trust. It would actually be vaguely suspicious if I kept spending all that time - eventually people will ask, where &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the money coming from? So I'm going to set up a Liberapay and Patreon (barring extremely strong protestation from the gathered masses) to justify spending more time writing, community building, and paying for the servers that run whatever we use to connect the community. I understand if that sounds awful given my prior commitment to keeping everything totally unmonetized. If it helps at all, I'm only expecting around $200 a month maximum (10% of 2000 readers doing $1 a month is already a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; aggressive estimate), and I'm going to do everything even if it turns out $0 because I'm unhinged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vii"&gt;VII.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that's everything. Some of this is mundane, some of it is silly, some of it is very serious. I'll catch you for our regularly scheduled writing soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the clearing stands a boxer&lt;br&gt;
And a fighter by his trade&lt;br&gt;
And he carries the reminders&lt;br&gt;
Of every glove that laid him down&lt;br&gt;
Or cut him till he cried out in his anger and his shame&lt;br&gt;
"I am leaving, I am leaving", but the fighter still remains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/on-authenticity-and-whats-worth-doing/</guid></item><item><title>You Must Read At Least One Book To Ride</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/you-must-read-at-least-one-book-to-ride/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Two things are true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is going to sound bad in a culture where engineers are encouraged to apologize for existing while it is totally acceptable for a grifter that can't code to insist that they're a "thought leader". It is that, in my immediate professional environment, I am consistently acknowledged to be one of the best engineers around. As a rough rule, I study more than the average engineer around me by up to two orders of magnitude. I've been made an offer at the senior level at one of the best companies in the state, various Serious People happily re-employ me, and become incensed when I see lazy commit messages. I'm doin' pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second, and this one is going to sound bad because I sometimes need to convince people to employ me, is that I am &lt;em&gt;clearly worse&lt;/em&gt; than almost everyone that emails me along all of these dimensions. I only have a dim understanding of how my 3-4 years of experience coming from a strong background in &lt;em&gt;psychology&lt;/em&gt; has rounded to "senior engineer", I've only ever written tests for personal projects because no employer I've ever seen actually had &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; working tests or interest in getting them, and I wrote the entirety of my Master's thesis code without version control because one of the best universities in the country doesn't teach it. In short, I've never solved a &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; hard problem, I'm just out here clicking the "save half a million dollar" button that no one else noticed. I'm a fucking moron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know the second is true because I see how truly complex some of the things people do for a living are, and I know the first is true because I have been effortlessly &lt;em&gt;cruising&lt;/em&gt; my way to the top 3-4% of the country's income bracket as an immigrant. &lt;em&gt;How are they both true?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i"&gt;I.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout high school, I was a truly horrendous art student. It was my least favourite class, as I had recently moved to an international school, and the local Malaysian syllabus didn't waste time on things like "creativity", or "culture", or really anything other than maths and language. I'd turn up, I'd not really understand how the other students from Western backgrounds were translating mental images into drawings so effortlessly, and I'd score the lowest possible passing grade. Eventually I decided that I "wasn't artsy" and didn't draw anything other than doodled cubes for about ten years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great deal of life experience later, I decided that it simply couldn't be that hard, and it would be an amazing accomplishment to get through this barrier. In 2022, I tried a course called &lt;a href="https://drawabox.com/"&gt;Drawabox&lt;/a&gt;, which was incredibly boring and led to no progress. On a whim, I decided to look on &lt;em&gt;Hackernews&lt;/em&gt;, a place that at the time I thought of as exclusively for technical articles, for a good drawing tutorial, whereas previously I had allowed myself to be guided onto the rocky shoals of Reddit. They are actually dumber on there, sorry Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led me to Betty Edward's &lt;a href="https://www.drawright.com/"&gt;Drawing On The Right Side Of The Brain&lt;/a&gt;, a book whose title profoundly upsets me as someone that left psychology due to the field's horrendous epistemology. The book came with glowing recommendations, but it also came with &lt;a href="https://www.drawright.com/before-after/marks-before-and-after-selfportrait-drawings"&gt;before and after&lt;/a&gt; pictures that I assumed were too good to be true. The &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; picture felt so unattainable that saying you could get to that level felt like a weight loss scam. Still, I was determined, and my intuition said the testimonials were real despite all of that, so I gave it a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing the book asks you to do is draw your hand as best as you can, so that you've got a frame of reference. I sat still for 30-45 minutes and poured my heart and soul into it. This is the result I got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A malformed drawing of a left hand, with too-long fingers and a bulbous thumb." src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/73ba7ae7.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was &lt;em&gt;the best drawing I had ever made in my life&lt;/em&gt; at the time, and it clearly leaves a lot to be desired. The book continues by providing some theory and exercises. The first exercise after this was to trace the lines in a drawing by eye, and if I recall, you are asked to trace it upside-down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Upside_Down_Man.jpeg" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/97b580f4.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was actually more-or-less exactly what the drawing was. At this point, I have done exactly two drawings, with no unshown practice of what I assumed was the vital mechanical skill of drawing, but decide to trace two more (from the internet this time) while dogsitting at a friend's house. You will note that these are both strongly nerdy fantasy-themed, because at the end of the day, I am very much a stereotypical programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Knight_Drawing.jpeg" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/ae262928.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Dragon_Drawing.jpeg" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/83f658e8.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;em&gt;these&lt;/em&gt; are the best drawings of my life, &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; with no unseen practice. They're a bit unclean and I made the initial components &lt;em&gt;way too big&lt;/em&gt; so they both don't fit on the page. But at this point, as simple as these look, I am flabbergasted at the results I've gotten. I've lost 100 KGs with this One Simple Trick, doctors hate me (but this is because I didn't go into medicine like my parents wanted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea if this newfound skill carries over when I'm not tracing lines, and instead drawing from life. I read a chapter or two more, and finally, with great trepidation, I take a stab at drawing my hand again. And is thus that, in about six hours of reading and practice spread over months, I moved from this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A malformed drawing of a left hand, with too-long fingers and a bulbous thumb." src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/73ba7ae7.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A pretty good hand drawn from a foreshortened perspective!" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/d02dbded.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A hand making a finger gun!" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/b4dada97.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was prepared to go &lt;em&gt;my entire life&lt;/em&gt; missing out on the joys of art until I picked up the right book. I am still typically the worst artist when I enter a room full of artists, but people &lt;em&gt;outside those rooms&lt;/em&gt; (who didn't read one book) occasionally think I'm pretty okay, which is something I never expected to experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-the-one-book-barrier"&gt;II. The One Book Barrier&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, there seem to be two major clumps of engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are the engineers who have read 1+ books on a given topic, and sometimes on &lt;em&gt;several&lt;/em&gt; topics, and they all come off as extremely competent. These are, for the most part, the people that make up the audience of this blog. Of course, you do not &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; need to read a book - a sufficiently high volume of technical blogs or courses are probably the equivalent at varying levels of efficiency - but take it for granted there is some Large Sum of information that someone has studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are engineers (and people in every profession) who &lt;em&gt;never try for the entirety of their careers&lt;/em&gt;, and this is the majority of every profession. I spoke to a reader who is employed as an extremely high-level engineer, Seth Newman - by the way, I'll connect you if you want to hire a genius data engineer in the U.S - who described the average professional as sleepwalking through their working lives, and this rung true. Of course, they are not &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; asleep so something else is going wrong, but the description still seemed apt. There is movement - enough movement to fall down a flight of stairs - but none of the awareness needed to avoid such an outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are people like myself, where I have read &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; one good book on most topics relevant to my profession, but have never gone particularly deep. I have a firm grasp of the Git data model through Pro Git, for example, but know nothing about the algorithms underlying it - which is still enough to dominate a truly randomly selected engineer. I've read enough of the arcane tomes that I can cast a cantrip and it looks like magic to the sleepwalking, but I look at a project like &lt;a href="https://github.com/evennia/evennia"&gt;Evennia&lt;/a&gt; and realize that some people are out there casting Quickened Silent Still Maximized Disintegrate, which is &lt;em&gt;extremely impressive&lt;/em&gt; for the non-D&amp;amp;D nerds out there. I have spoken to high-performers in all sorts if fields at this point, and &lt;em&gt;every single one&lt;/em&gt; has said that their profession is plagued by people that are essentially not even trying. I'm not sure how this is possible in things like medicine - have you seen how hard they have to work to pass those exams? - but it is nonetheless true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-our-endless-numbered-levels"&gt;III. Our Endless, Numbered Levels&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same conversation with Seth, I asked about what allowed him to work on the type of problem he was involved in, while I'm out here just trying to convince people to stop applying "flexible" schemas to every problem as if MongoDB has taken their kids hostage. This led to the topic of how deep specializations can go, and just how goddamn good people can get. I know very little about basketball, but Seth linked me to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i93vF0WOX6w"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; where one of the worst players in the NBA, ten years post-retirement and out-of-shape, assassinates both amateur and professional athletes from lesser tiers. And he's &lt;em&gt;one of the worst players&lt;/em&gt;, or so I've been told by people that actually know basketball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I can give a good example from my own experience too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in Melbourne, I was considered a decent sabre fencer. I cleaned up most other amateurs, but there were always a couple of people around that would just wipe me out then go compete for the State championship. In particular, I've mentioned in &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/fury-driven-development/"&gt;earlier writing&lt;/a&gt; that I trained with a guy that eventually won Nationals here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That guy once fenced someone trying to qualify for the Olympics, and was unable to score a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; point on him. So we know that someone &lt;em&gt;struggling&lt;/em&gt; to qualify for the Olympics is way better than the best fencer I know, and arguably the best in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malaysia entered one fencer into the 2012 Olympics, Yu Peng Kean, who was eliminated &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fencing_at_the_2012_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_sabre"&gt;&lt;em&gt;15 to 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by the guy that actually won that year. There are fencers that seriously train that can barely score a point on me. I can barely score against the top guy in Australia. That guy can barely score against someone trying to make the Olympics, and &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; guy can probably barely score against the guy that actually won the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually hardly a surprising result. One only needs to look at Magnus Carlsen's absolute domination of chess players that have trained their whole life, but it &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; different when you're actually going up against it yourself. Competing against the top fencer in Australia feels &lt;em&gt;oppressive&lt;/em&gt;. He is always effortlessly slightly out of reach, slightly faster, slightly more precise, and you're left feeling like a toddler trying to tackle an adult. And because I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have that level of edge over some people, untrained as they are, I know that's &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what it's like from his perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are two steps &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; that large &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; you get to the National champion level? &lt;em&gt;Jesus Christ&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-incentives"&gt;IV. Incentives&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an aside, but there are many areas where I sleepwalk. I have mentioned many times that I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; making good progress on my piano lessons, and while it is true that I feel like I lack some natural talent in the area, it is also true that I simply don't practice enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I don't play the piano professionally and no one would pay me to do so. I can't help but feel that something has gone dreadfully wrong in society in that we've decided to start incentivizing people with no talent or interest to participate in the technology space. Many of them are extremely wide awake in other areas, be it sports, art, mathematics, whatever. Unfortunately for complex reasons related to some sectors having more money than they know what to do with, large organizations being impossibly hard to run well, and talking magazines covers trying to launder company funds into personal status, we're willing to pay people to be extremely bad programmers and extremely bad leaders. In fact, calling yourself a PowerBI developer is probably the single easiest way in the world to slack off 6+ hours a day in air-conditioned rooms at &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; above an average wage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But since they're producing nothing &lt;em&gt;anyway&lt;/em&gt;, or are a net negative to society accounting for opportunity cost, I can't help but feel that they'd somehow be so much more fulfilled if they got the sack somehow and we provided them all that money to just like, take care of their children and stop fucking around with databases they keep damaging. Of course, that likely isn't actually feasible (especially at executive compensation) but I can't stop thinking of this quote from the late Christopher Hitchens:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/NegtQIkhz6g?si=O_5rhL0_cG9VvuD0&amp;amp;t=24"&gt;My worst job was my first job.&lt;/a&gt; It was very important to me, because in those days you had to be a member of the union to get a job in Fleet Street, in London journalism. And I couldn't get into the union so I couldn't get a job. And if you couldn't get a job then you couldn't get a union card. But finally there was a new job created - for a new magazine - I can still pronounce its horrible name, "The London Times Higher Education Supplement". And because it was a new job I didn't need to join the union, it was a new creation, so I got job and union card, and I was so proud, and so happy. I was the social science editor... and I cannot tell you how boring it was and how bad I was at it. And how I would literally watch the clock as the long day crept by. But it was a job, and it brought me to London, and it made me a member of the National Union of Journalists. And it was everything I wanted and it made me miserable. Finally, I was so bad at it that it could no longer be concealed from the editor. I got the sack, very traditionally in Britain, I got the sack on Christmas Eve. I was very depressed, I thought "how will I ever recover", "I'll never get another job", "maybe I can't even keep my union card". But I still sometimes think about it, and think "If I had been any good at that job, I might still be doing it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v"&gt;V.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something about having your skin in the game is that your relationship with sleepwalkers changes. That is, instead of resenting them, you're &lt;em&gt;glad that they're so bad&lt;/em&gt; because they give you people to beat without having to dedicate your entire life to perfect performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's some great reading on a similar concept in video games by Dan Luu, on how it takes &lt;a href="https://danluu.com/p95-skill/"&gt;very little effort&lt;/a&gt; to be a high performer. To be a high performer either means that you can do some fairly unambiguous task (like a backflip) &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; it can mean that you're performing well relative to other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading one book &lt;em&gt;typically&lt;/em&gt; gets you to the point where you can do things like "add new functionality to this React app without incurring technical debt". This is good enough to make an ethical living, so long as you intelligently chose to do a thing that society pays for - sorry if you didn't, I'd build society differently if I was writing the rules. Reading multiple books is how you get good enough to compete for the absolute highest-paid jobs out there, where the fact you can do the above in a day instead of a week matters, and in the latter case you're simply going to have to read N+1 books, where N is whatever your competition is reading. It's an arms race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But because Deloitte and the average developer don't read &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; books, they're just easy pickings. When you're trading off all your skin-in-the-game and working a permanent job, your interactions with these people leave you feeling helpless. You have to work with whoever the boss tells you too, and if they suck then you just have to deal with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're a bit more mercenary, then you get to turn up to interviews/meetings and dunk on them all day, and still have time to work out and be lazy. The last time I interviewed at a serious company, I was informed that I obliterated the competition so thoroughly that I "turned the planet into glass from orbit", and &lt;em&gt;I was still a weaker engineer than any of the seniors already at that company&lt;/em&gt;. There are some jobs where I can't compete with the empty-suited masses, like perhaps government contracts, but that's because those industries aren't in the business of buying what I'm selling. I'm selling results and trust. Big enterprise is buying plausible lies that get executives promoted. I'll beat big consultants &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; time with the kind of person I actually want to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heck, you could probably eliminate almost all dud candidates during technical interviews by asking what their favourite tech book is, then only talking to candidates where you know enough to check if they've read that book. You'd have a false negative on anyone that read a great book you didn't know about, but I'm guessing almost no false positives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vi"&gt;VI.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now we get to a complicated case - what about the people that try very hard but nonetheless get no results? I know several people that run teams incompetently but are &lt;em&gt;genuinely trying&lt;/em&gt;. However, no amount of training seems to get them there. They harass engineers, they panic, they don't know how to hire, they usually overestimate their own skill, but they're &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt;. They just &lt;em&gt;keep&lt;/em&gt; trying to get Scrum right. They're sleepwalking straight into a lake, and all we can see are the flailing arms of a drowning person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are all sorts of things that cause this outcome, but I wanted to highlight a meta-skill that many of us have but can't quite articulate, and I suspect it's what they're missing. That is, how do you know what books to read?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I started with &lt;em&gt;Drawabox&lt;/em&gt; which was plausible on its face, but found that Betty Edward's book was substantially better for my goals. In fact, not only was it better, Drawabox simply assumed that I knew the One Weird Trick that Edwards highlighted, and moved straight on to mechanical skill - it is entirely possible I could have gotten through the whole course and had no appreciable progress with that missing puzzle piece. There were actually quite a few resources available, but I had some inkling I was on the wrong track. How do we have people that are basically doing the same thing with Scrum and not thinking "Wait, this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; working, what am I doing wrong? Is this even remotely the right course?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think I can explain &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; how I do it, or if there's a precise algorithm. It certainly seems like you need a little bit of bullshit detection, so in the tech space I'll typically only read something from a person who has built something impressive themselves. Big points for maintaining something open source or otherwise having some indicator of knowledge that is impossible to fake. If they've built something more nebulous, like "a big company", they score far fewer points because you can luck out or bullshit your way there. You can't lie your way into code compiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some other weird rules too, none of them hard and fast. Catchy names tend to result in getting dinged for a bit. The best books seem to have either boring or sophisticated covers. Anything with the word "leadership" in it is probably nonsense. The more the author brags about their awards, the more I think they're lying. A colloquial tone (like mine, sadly) tends to lose a few points, though it isn't a knockdown if the topics are nuanced. Thinking about this now, these are all things that seem extremely convincing to the drowning sleepwalkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management at my day job brought us an Agile consultant the other day, who they loved, but they asked the engineers "How highly we'd rate our Agile training on a scale of 1 - 5" when that questions doesn't even mean anything. Some people &lt;em&gt;loved it&lt;/em&gt;, and there's almost a 100% correlation with their love of that session and their reading of the wrong books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; a book, you have to be able to discard large segments that don't have merit. The Phoenix Project is a good example: Gene Kim has written a whole book about organizational transformation, but he only put &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; bad actor into the whole book then made everyone else super competent and earnest. That's &lt;em&gt;not what big companies are like&lt;/em&gt;, so you need to have enough of your brain switched on to get the good ideas then realize the rest of it is cringe-worthy leadership fanfic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not having whatever that ability is seems to cripple many people's ability to learn and better themselves. This is why it's so concerning when you hear some executives disclose their reading material - it is typically &lt;em&gt;immediately obvious&lt;/em&gt; that there is almost no way they are actually good at their job. It is similarly why my eyes roll back into my skull when a leader tells me they do their learning on LinkedIn - like, what the fuck are you sickos on about? Have vendors been causing you brain damage to make sales easier?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vii"&gt;VII.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was going to say that this was a post about how we should all take a moment to reflect on the unreasonable effectiveness of cracking open a book in the age of YouTube, but I guess what I actually want to say is &lt;em&gt;do not under any circumstances encourage people to read books&lt;/em&gt;, it's easy money for the rest of us. My next blog post is going to be filled with anti-Git propaganda and links to Scrum resources. Godspeed, you glorious bastards.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/you-must-read-at-least-one-book-to-ride/</guid></item><item><title>Fury Driven Development</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/fury-driven-development/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This is the view from my window at this second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A picture of rooftops in Melbourne at night" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/8e525d2f.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two significant things about this picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is if that you squint very hard at the very center, you can just about make out a chair lying on the adjacent rooftop. Despite living in one of the fancier areas of Melbourne, someone threw that out there four years ago, and there it has lain through the entirety of my working life. I'm quite fond of that chair for reasons that are beyond my reckoning - it has watched me rise for approximately 1,533 days, through every job and relationship I've had since leaving university, through one bout of (blessedly resolved) depression, and that time I somehow stubbed my right little toe five times on the same bedpost in one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second thing is that I am writing at 6AM. This is because I went to bed simply furious, slept fitfully for a few hours, then awoke furious and &lt;em&gt;calculating&lt;/em&gt; which is much, much worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i"&gt;I.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was directed to a very thoughtful person writing the following yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i ❤️ lucidity, glad to see they are happier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a heartwarming sentiment and it is true! I was actually quite happy last year, but I am indeed happier this year. I'm a director at a company with my best friends, I'm going to be in a resort in Fiji for my birthday, then exploring Europe with interesting and ensouled people. I just played a great session of Burning Wheel last night (with two of my co-directors), have board games lined up for the weekend, three days of improv shows, so on, so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also true that this is &lt;em&gt;perfectly compatible&lt;/em&gt; with every molecule of my being charged with an incandescent rage so potent that I glow white-hot in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, two minor events initiated a chain reaction that turned me into a fury elemental after a very calm January, leading to the current moonlit staccato of keyboard fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is that I was asked to examine an error in something happening in our CI/CD pipelines. We use an excellent tool called &lt;a href="https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core"&gt;dbt&lt;/a&gt;, which for the non-data nerds out there only does one thing relevant for this story - it lets you write Python that emits SQL. We had a script that was supposed to write to a database called &lt;code&gt;governance&lt;/code&gt;, but in practice was executing &lt;code&gt;use governance&lt;/code&gt; and then for an unknown reason was &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt; running &lt;code&gt;use test&lt;/code&gt;, so everything executed against the wrong database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, simple enough. If no one knows why this is happening, the logical conclusion is that we've written some Python that has an unexpected side effect which keeps switching us to &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt;. I'll just go check the source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scrumlord (TM), the very one &lt;em&gt;that raised this issue&lt;/em&gt;, says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please don't spend too much time on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii"&gt;II.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day, the New York Times carries a motto in a box on its front page. "All the News That's Fit to Print," it says. It's been saying it for decades, day in and day out. I imagine most readers of the canonical sheet have long ceased to notice this bannered and flaunted symbol of its mental furniture. I myself check every day to make sure that the bright, smug, pompous, idiotic claim is still there. Then I check to make sure that it still irritates me. If I can still exclaim, under my breath, why do they insult me and what do they take me for and what the hell is it supposed to mean unless it's as obviously complacent and conceited and censorious as it seems to be, then at least I know I still have a pulse. You may wish to choose a more rigorous mental workout but I credit this daily infusion of annoyance with extending my lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually really like this person outside of work, but Jesus Christ, I am a grown man. Do you know what that means? It means that I pay taxes, and that I can take responsibility for things. Instead of flailing my arms in the air helplessly whenever someone has a problem and emitting platitudes like "I'm sorry to hear that", I've spent years cultivating the financial reserves as a brown immigrant in Australia to fucking wave my debit card and disappear those problems like the world's most helpful magician. At some point my parents are going to get sick, and &lt;em&gt;I am going to disappear as much of that problem as possible and I'm not going to whine about it&lt;/em&gt;, and let me check my notes, &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-accidentally-saved-half-a-million-dollars/"&gt;I knocked half a million dollars off our cloud bill last year&lt;/a&gt;. I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; that I &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; know how much time the various bits of engineering in our purview require. That's why my title says &lt;em&gt;engineer&lt;/em&gt; and yours say something about &lt;em&gt;project management&lt;/em&gt;. Can you imagine me telling my electrician how to allocate their time to fucking &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;? No? Crazy, right? &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; am the electrician in this situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presumably you have decided to staff this entire department with functioning adults, as evidenced by the many people here raising healthy and happy children, which makes it all the more bewildering that it seemed worthwhile to muster up your ailing neuronal reserves, open your mouth, and incant the dread syllables of Power Word: Moron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Don't spend too much time on this."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then &lt;em&gt;why did you bring this up&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phew. I'm glad I got that out of my system. It probably isn't healthy to be that angry over something so minor. Oh, I see someone has left a note on this Jira card. It's the same person. I left this card for two days while our lead data engineer was on leave, as they've spent months thinking about how this particular package should be configured before it gets deployed to our environment. What does that note say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please try to control the scope on this card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii"&gt;III.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, a year after starting fencing, I went up against my first left-handed opponent in a competition. They were considerably younger than me, but trained with the women's national sabre champion, and absolutely &lt;em&gt;demolished&lt;/em&gt; me. I was so distraught at the ease with which my technique had been dissected that dropping to my knees and yelling their name furiously into the sky like a thwarted villain became an in-joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chastised, I thought for about thirty minutes, then invited the only other left-handed fencer at that competition to start training at my university club. At the time he wasn't very good (and despite being &lt;em&gt;so tall&lt;/em&gt; that we all thought he was 17, was actually 14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fenced him &lt;em&gt;obsessively&lt;/em&gt; for six months, and when I rematched my left-handed nemesis (who didn't even remember my name), it was one of the most surgical victories I've ever scored - enough so that their famously grumpy coach looked like they had some harsh words as they stepped off the piste. I then proceeded to lose to every right-hander, but you know what? That doesn't matter. Contrary to what people say, vengeance is the best vengeance. And that 14 year old, now a grown man that trains 14 year olds I can't beat, won the national championship a few years later. I don't even know what the lesson in &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; development is, but let's pretend the vengeance was good for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the point of that story, you may ask? It's that if you piss me off enough, I will &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; study the blade while you talk about Agile all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv"&gt;IV.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all might seem like a gross overreaction to two messages, but this is simply the final manifestation of disrespect that I'm willing to tolerate. The thing I am the proudest of in my life is the quality of the company I keep. Every single person in my life is absolutely awesome, and this is largely because I have a zero-tolerance policy for toxicity. I'm asked about where I find so many great people and the advice I give everyone is the same. Don't tolerate bad behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I've started working:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CEO of my first employer in Southeast Asia, Joel Sng (now being sued for embezzlement), would routinely illegally salary Malaysian employees below the minimum wage. When I raised this with management, it was one of the two times someone has dared to raise their voice at me in the last 11 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At my first job in Australia, the director of our organization allowed my contract to lapse for two weeks, then only re-employed me after I promised to take on a project &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; too intense for a fresh grad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At my second job, an executive at &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; organization only agreed to extend my work visa after getting me to promise that I had no intention of ever leaving the company (very cool and not exploitative at all!), and had the nerve to scream at me over the phone when I left the second I got my permanent residency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I saved my current employer AUD 500K and received an AUD 60 gift voucher in return, but was denied a raise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to set a positive example for those in similar positions, I always left within three months of each insult into a better environment for more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this absolute son of a bitch has the &lt;em&gt;gall&lt;/em&gt; to talk to me like I'm a twelve year old that's watching too much TV. The issue isn't that what he said is particularly terrible - he's a lovely and compassionate person when his brain isn't Scrumbled eggs - it's that I realized I need to do something or I'm a &lt;em&gt;hypocrite&lt;/em&gt;. And it's all part of a broader social dynamic that I have best seen illustrated in &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34893850"&gt;this excellent bit of writing&lt;/a&gt; by friend of the blog, Matt Mitchell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sense of this is that what developers can bring to the modern world is the closest humanity has got to magic. And this dependency is resented. And this resentment leads to workplaces in which this resentment is externalised in the form of debasement (e.g. caricatures and other forms of ego compensation - "they're just the boffins, they don't have people skills!"), control ("the boffins can't really be trusted - better add some process and oversight, and given they don't have the people skills better make sure they aren't anywhere near management/clients!"), and dependency inversion ("sure the boffins can do their coding stuff, but they'd be nothing without us to help babysit and organise things, they don't get the way the world works, clearly it's they who actually need us!"). And this environment in turn leads developers to internalise this systemic resentment as a resentment of themselves, their capability, and their work, aka burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v"&gt;V.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Picture of Palpatine subtitled &amp;quot;Your hate has made you powerful&amp;quot;." src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/ab7ea135.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a fine line to walk when it comes to being anger-fueled. When it's done with bitterness, you lose your edge and simply do things that are emotionally satisfying but tactically unsound. I could have simply gotten &lt;em&gt;angry&lt;/em&gt; during my bout with my left-handed opponent, and I would have still lost. And this is always the immediate reaction. This is every employee who says "I'm going to quit if you don't give me that raise" and then gets absolutely blown out of the water. Success comes from a model of the world sufficiently accurate to produce good strategy, and the effective execution of precise tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought upon receiving the second message was: "Fuck this. I'm going to de-anonymize myself, deal with management being furious, then storm out the door and tear things up."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second thought was: "Calm down."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a good evening, woke up, noticed I was still angry, and started constructing tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, what was I going to get out of storming out the door? A fleeting moment of satisfaction followed by... what, another garbage employer? That's nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, what was anyone &lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt; going to get out of that? A funny, angry blog post? Don't get me wrong, that'd be a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; post, but that doesn't seem worth the tradeoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, what's the future of this whole writing thing? It's fun ranting sometimes, but I'd estimate that this blog is voluntarily received by about 700 - 800 people, most of whom are professionals rather than Reddit midwits, and then an unknown number of people who it gets shared with. And from my emails, I know that I've somehow attracted extremely intelligent and compassionate people despite half my content being immature at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to top it all off, some people at my workplace know about this blog already, and I reckon I'm one or two more HN frontpage events from being drawn and quartered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I can either control the detonation, or I can get a sudden email from HR without any preparation. The former sounds better to me, but I'll have to be careful. Here are the two things I want to talk about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upskilling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Networking and this platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upcoming sections are filled with requests for support (of the non-financial variety) and a shared vision for what I'd like to do since I guess I somehow have a platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vi-upskilling-pettiness"&gt;VI. Upskilling &amp;amp; Pettiness&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm in my shed putting spikes
On the rims of my car for the upcoming death race
You best to spectate, please do not get in
My way, you just stay in that left lane
I push the pedal, it sound like a jet plane
I hit your rental as hard as my pen game&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing required to be a grifter, inadvertently or not, is to have your presentation skills outstrip your technical skill. Because I'm not willing to subject myself to audience capture, I have no choice but to continue selling my programming ability and not my writing. I'm no slouch, but I have &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much to learn after working with mediocre organizations for so long. And, unfortunately in this case, my presentation skills are quite good, so I'm going to need to get much better at technical work to ethically protect my livelihood in the event that big employers no longer wish to associate with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this note, I spend a lot of time talking to Healthscope's &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-coulter-4a566319/?originalSubdomain=au"&gt;Dave Coulter&lt;/a&gt;. It is entirely plausible that he is one of Australia's foremost data leaders from a technical, strategic, and human perspective. Despite his strong corporate energy, I have seen him emit a muffled scream into a sandwich while staring dead-eyed at an Oracle database, so he is the real deal, unlike the ten-thousand "thought leaders" who aren't &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; charismatic enough for the TED talks they so desperately crave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something fascinating about Dave is that he's a literature major who now earns the big bucks. He fell into a senior data science role with no experience in the space, then was moved to a lead data engineer role with no experience in that space either, and now he's some sort of VIP. He knocked it out of the park every time, and when I made the jump to data engineering myself, he'd call me at 10 PM on weekdays (while raising kids!) to teach me. I can identify &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of Dave's work at my current employer &lt;em&gt;instantly&lt;/em&gt; because it's the only stuff that doesn't burn my fucking eyes out of my goddamn skull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once asked him &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; he pushed himself this hard. I've never seen someone study that hard while balancing adult life and I &lt;em&gt;grew up in Asia&lt;/em&gt;. And we worked at the same dysfunctional organizations, so it wasn't like he was running on some wholesome motivation I had yet to tap. His was a career filled with doing the word, saying the right things, then being overruled by mediocre consultants. He looked very thoughtful and then said only: "Mostly pettiness."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, step one. Get &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good, because that makes it a lot harder to be blackballed. Even if no one wants to ever give me a permanent contract again, the market always needs wizards with social skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why sunlight is now streaming through my window, and I have a copy of &lt;em&gt;Star Schema: The Complete Reference&lt;/em&gt; open. By the end of 2024, I am going to be able to deallocate people in real life with the merest glance. With God as my witness, I have been fucked with for the absolute last time, and the first step to ensuring this never happens again is a tyrant's grasp of the machine spirit's whims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this effect, if you consider yourself good at &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; tech related, including leadership, product management, and actual engineering &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; are willing to share resources or wisdom, please reach out to me (ludicity.hackernews@gmail.com). This is no time for modesty. As always, anything very useful will probably get written about as a public service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vii-platform"&gt;VII. Platform&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step two, get networked. Knowing people is how you protect yourself, and how you help other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't expect to every have anything approximating a platform when I punched out a &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/most-data-work-seems-fundamentally-worthless/"&gt;frustrated article&lt;/a&gt; in February last year, but nonetheless this has somehow happened. I made an offhand Mastodon post about an equally furious writer in the security space at &lt;a href="https://crankysec.com/blog/shite/"&gt;CrankySec&lt;/a&gt; a few days ago, and that somehow directed enough traffic there for a Discord server with 250 professionals in it a few days later, which is &lt;em&gt;not at all&lt;/em&gt; what I intended - that isn't even a platform I have good reach on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be a lot safer when I'm visibly associated with something so large - but I also think it's a huge wasted opportunity to just rant. I've found a job for one person through here, and received emails saying I've helped a lot of people find confidence or process their situation - but I can't shake the feeling that winning the reach lottery comes with a lot of responsibility. If I want to stay authentic and help others do the same, without any of us being crushed by The System, I'll need to ensure that people can actually mobilize in mutual support. Once I have the vague feeling that I'm connected enough to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be utterly vulnerable to C-suite psychos and an Australian lawyer has confirmed that I can't get in legal trouble for my writing, I'm just going to drop the anonymity entirely and undergo a controlled detonation at my day job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that effect, I'd like to ask anyone that's willing to associate with me in public, as professionals, on the Field Of Eternal Bullshit known as LinkedIn to reach out to me via email (ludicity.hackernews@gmail.com) and we'll connect - even if the body is nothing but a link to your profile, I'll add you. I hate LinkedIn, but there is a huge difference between shouting about soulful treatment of tech workers into the void versus being able to shout it under my real name, and it's the only platform that has something approximating a professional avatar of me. I'd like to think of a more convenient way for people to add me (logging in and emailing me is extremely annoying for you, I know) but I still think it would be a terrible idea to link directly to my profile. I'd be one click away from the wrong person sending me to the HR gulag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will also be &lt;em&gt;very funny&lt;/em&gt; if I start saying honest things on my currently empty LinkedIn feed to an audience that'll boost it further than the current trough of fucking inane swill that comprises that Godforsaken land of blasted sand and sociopaths. And, as some readers will attest, I am always &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; email away from trying to find you work if it all goes sideways, which is much easier to do when I can boost someone on corporate platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you have experience with producing a podcast, guidance on how to do it right would be great - I'm willing to pay for time to get advice on this. Yes, I'm going to kick one off as I've been talking to a reader a week for a year, and tons of amazing discussions are being wasted entirely on my three brain cells. I've spoken to people that have done forensic work with the U.S Marshals, ex-CERN superbrains, and people that have kept satellites in orbit. And I'm just like, some dude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's going to consist entirely of interesting discussion on all things related to technology and flourishing in the modern workplace - it'll be under my real name, but I'll find &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; way to leak it to everyone here, even if it's just dropping a post here and deleting it 24 hours later. It will never run an ad or corporate sponsorship, and I will shut it down rather than allow this to happen - I have no idea what my stance is on Patreon and the like, but the reason I don't have one here is that I think it's still ethically compromising, so that's probably off the table too. This unfortunately means it will publish very infrequently as I must perform labor in exchange for food, but I'll try to make every episode a banger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also swear not to host self-help dorks trying to sell their latest book, or invite any sentient LinkedIn posts. If someone starts talking about their NFT, I will fucking murder them on air to preserve the listening experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="viii"&gt;VIII.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that's about it. I'm going on a demented study-and-build-a-platform arc because one person told me not to waste too much time on something. Behold a rationality so cold that it has wrapped around and burns like fire. This will quite possibly mark the beginning of substantial professional and financial difficulty for me because of &lt;em&gt;one Jira card&lt;/em&gt; but I guarantee the remainder of 2024 won't be &lt;em&gt;boring&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A picture out my window in the morning." src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/c13189ca.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/fury-driven-development/</guid></item><item><title>My Company Has Earned Its First Paycheck</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/my-company-has-earned-its-first-paycheck/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I've believed for a while that, if my company died, the most likely scenario would be dying without a single dollar earned. There are so many ways for this to play out. It's an endless minefield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's just not talking to any real humans, which is the number one way that I've seen people fail at starting their businesses. They just start working on some product, frequently with some extremely poor intuitions around what people would actually pay for, and then they ship and the customers never come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's being uncharismatic. There's not making time. There's having the wrong business partners. There's being poorly networked. There's being well-networked but being unsure how to progress the relationship. There's doing the work for free to "build a relationship". There's being able to progress the relationship, but only making money by charging a supreme discount "to build a portfolio", which I don't count - this is giving away your services for free with extra steps. Hoo boy, there are a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of ways to explode with nothing earned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, we got paid and have follow-up work. It is a tiny sum of money - AUD 2,500 of non-recurring revenue for 8 hours of work... which is &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what a Big Fucking Consultant charges out their staff at, so I'm &lt;em&gt;counting&lt;/em&gt; it. If we die now, it will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be at the $0 mark, and it is &lt;em&gt;happening&lt;/em&gt;. A company with revenue in the millions and executives with a lot of sports cars took us seriously. And as &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/registering-my-hypotheses-on-starting-a-business/"&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt;, here's how it happened (with identifying details changed), some thoughts, replicable strategies, and notes on the experience. With all of these tools at your disposal, you too can guarantee that your company will be guaranteed a tombstone with the storied &amp;gt;$0 revenue dead, rather than the sad $0 dorks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of wasting time adding a disclaimer fifty times, I'm going to say it once here - any advice below, no matter how confidently delivered, is coming from a 29 year, and it cannot be emphasized enough that I don't know fuck all about anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i-for-gods-sake-talk-to-people"&gt;I. For God's Sake, Talk to People&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people ask things like "How do you get started freelancing?". I've &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; people ask that, and have been the person asking that question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's really easy and some people won't like the answer. You reach out to every single person that thinks well of you, and you say "I've started a company that does this and we're looking for people that have problems in this space." This is overwhelmingly how I've received &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; job I've taken on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-talking-to-people"&gt;The Unreasonable Effectiveness Of Talking To People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I graduated, I emailed a &lt;em&gt;psychology&lt;/em&gt; professor (the awesome &lt;a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/joshua-wiley"&gt;Joshua Wiley&lt;/a&gt; who I've since learned has written a book on deep learning, and whose &lt;a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/bei-bei"&gt;equally awesome wife&lt;/a&gt; helped me escape the siren song of doing a PhD) that I had met &lt;em&gt;once&lt;/em&gt; for five minutes, three years ago, to send him a snippet of a programming assignment and to let him know I needed a job. Two weeks later, another professor had an emergency related to a PhD student being unable to clean some eye-tracking data before an important deadline. Enter me - I billed them for 15 hours of work and solved the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after this, it was time to get an actual job as my visa was coming in. I had just watched my brother take six months to get a job despite being brilliant (due to our visa situation), so I knew throwing my CV into the void was stupid. I employed a nifty trick that I will only share over email to avoid handing firepower to the spammers of the world, and reached out to someone &lt;em&gt;outside HR&lt;/em&gt; that didn't care about my visa status but did care about not hiring an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="First_Job_Message.png" src="https://mataroa.blog/images/2bc3bbeb.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bothering to actually call and sound intelligent over the phone guaranteed me an interview. And of course, I had already attended a AUD 300 interview coaching session with &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jameslynchinterviewucan2/?originalSubdomain=au"&gt;James Lynch&lt;/a&gt;, which means I had a huge leg up over the average candidate. I had one project under my belt thanks to Josh. I ate the other candidates alive - I still remember how sad the next candidate looked after hearing all the laughter coming out of the interview room - and had a job as a data &lt;em&gt;scientist&lt;/em&gt;. Yep, through wild circumstance, I applied to be a sad data analyst but they had a data &lt;em&gt;scientist&lt;/em&gt; gig open that they gave me. I had a job the day after my visa cleared at AUD 100K. And my first point of contact is now one of my closest friends and mentors - that's a pretty good outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I talked to two people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every&lt;/em&gt; other job I've ever had was the result of meeting people on the job. Just. Talk. To. People. Let every human being you've ever met that might &lt;em&gt;possibly&lt;/em&gt; think well of you know &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what you're looking for, and ask them if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They can introduce you to someone who has achieved something similar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They can introduce you to someone who might need that work done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They can keep an eye out for you over the next few months&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequently the results manifest &lt;em&gt;months&lt;/em&gt; from when you make the initial contact, and most people never get back to you. I've spoken to friends who found work for me seven months after the initial request. The fourth member of my company is a medical professional I met at a machine learning conference in 2019, which I paid for out of my own pocket at AUD 500 as a broke student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for this job - I told a family member exactly what type of work I was looking for about ten months ago, and one day the CEO mentioned they needed help while he was in the room. One "I know someone that specializes in that!" later, I'm in their office taking requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I describe this whole approach to life as "maximizing your luck surface area", which I later found out is a term that has been independently coined in a few places. But as Taleb would put it, I'm leveraging asymmetry - I can say no to bad offers that are presented to me, so I suffer very little from massive exposure. For example, in the same time period as the story above, I received an offer to be a "lead data scientist" at a borderline fraudulent fintech company in Singapore for &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; enough money to not starve... so I said no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="but-im-not-good-at-networking"&gt;But I'm Not Good At Networking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I could think of an alternative, I would do that instead. I had to &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt; how to stop sitting around in my room playing video games all day. I had to learn how to find a good barber, how to dress myself like someone that at least commands a modicum of respect, and how to make small talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse than that, you have to learn how to &lt;em&gt;enjoy it&lt;/em&gt; or it'll be insincere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cunning"&gt;Cunning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be remiss not to acknowledge there were some unconventional steps in the above, such as paying for an interview coach. The expected value of a job in tech is probably at least AUD 80,000, so you would have to be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; confident in your interviewing skills to not think you can improve your interviewing enough for it to not pay for itself. I'm a firm believer that clear-eyed calculation and a love for the unorthodox is a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more valuable than "intelligence" as measured by IQ. I call this grab-bag of qualities "cunning".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kindness"&gt;Kindness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have benefited a lot from being selfless, as strange as that sounds. My girlfriend has commented (sometimes unhappily, though I'm working on it!) at how much time I spend helping people. A heuristic that might hint at the kind of thing I mean. I spend between AUD 100 - 200 buying other people lunch or dinner a month. That's approximately 7 nice meals a month, and I do it without thinking, for people that will probably &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; be in a position to do me a favour, especially if they're starving PhD students. I actively network on behalf of anyone that emails me looking for work, connect them to my personal network if they pass sanity checks, and am currently teaching two overseas friends enough programming to get their first tech jobs. I've spent AUD 120 this week on buying copies of &lt;a href="https://computerengineeringforbabies.com/"&gt;Computer Engineering For Babies&lt;/a&gt;, one for a coworker and one for a friend, both of whom have adorable little newborns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a happy way to live life, and it, through no particular strategy of my own, has probably paid off tenfold. As a rough rule, when I give the in the right way to people that I want to keep in my life, all the sordid accounting handles itself. And what I don't get back in money, I get back in companionship. And I've tried having lots of money and no soul - it was miserable, so I know what I prefer. I'm going to lose &lt;em&gt;so much money&lt;/em&gt; visiting readers in Europe, and I can't wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am probably going to deeply regret this when I'm old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-it-was-way-better-than-my-day-job"&gt;II. It Was Way Better Than My Day Job&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The service we provided was extremely simple. We helped a company evaluate all the potential business intelligence options for a very specific use case, wrote up a list of recommendations and sent it their way. We did this for free, as I considered it a pre-sales piece which would hopefully lead to us doing the implementation for them. However, I knew that they were good enough at engineering that there was a non-zero chance they'd do the work themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by spending an hour taking requirements from the team. We knew the vague shape of the problem from email exchanges, so I produced a literal physical checklist of every question we had for them (29 of them). I then spent two hours at their office taking requirements from their lead engineers, had lunch with their team, and went home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding all the extra time together, we spent five hours comparing various open-source tools against their requirements before eventually settling on a clear winner, and chucked together a markdown document. I paid for &lt;a href="https://www.remarq.io/"&gt;Remarq&lt;/a&gt; so that the markdown looked presentable, and we sent it to them. Eight hours all up, give or take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we finished, they ended up doing the work themselves... and were so happy with the recommendation that they &lt;em&gt;asked us to bill them anyway&lt;/em&gt; for the initial consult because they had more work for us, and didn't want us to feel like we got a bad deal on the last contact. And accepted a full AUD 2,500 bill without blinking, which is just straight up the rate for grabbing someone from Deloitte for eight hours. I can't get a goddamn raise from my actual employer for &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-accidentally-saved-half-a-million-dollars/"&gt;saving AUD &lt;em&gt;500,000&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and total strangers paid me the highest hourly rate I've ever received &lt;em&gt;as a courtesy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we can just say no to working with jerks! Prior to this job, we were contacted by an extremely small local company for an issue they had with a website. The owner was rude, questioned why we were quoting so much for a "simple" change (that would immediately have unbroken their payment portal which was losing thousands of dollars per day)... and we just dropped him on the spot. Good riddance, get fucked, have fun on Fiverr. Whereas at my day job, we have some absolute narcissistic, life-ruining bullies running some departments - as every big company does. I don't get a choice in whether I have to put up with it when an internal stakeholder behaves this way, unless they do something so atrocious that I can sue them over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-only-working-with-smart-ethical-friends-is-delightful"&gt;III. Only Working With Smart, Ethical Friends Is Delightful&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's not much to say about this, save that those eight hours of work were just incredible. I was treated &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much better by the client than I have been at any of my day jobs simply because I was an external party. And I'm not even treated badly at my day job! I'm just sort of a vague blob to the organization. The engineers probably think of me as that extremely outspoken guy, I suspect the middle managers know me as "that strange engineer with the dreadful eyes that see right through us", and the actually important people don't know me at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But working with my team, which has a final fixed size of six people... it was just so nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't have to waste time arguing with stupid ideas, because everyone who said something stupid (including me) would immediately abandon the position within seconds of issues being pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't have to waste time explaining what we were doing and what our ethical standards were, because I picked moral people. And it wasn't easy - there were two points where we realized we could hint at a particular solution and generate a huge pile of revenue. But someone would say "We don't do that here", and then we didn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can hit up anyone on the team and say anything from "design a distributed system for streaming data to the client's server" to "find out what our tax obligations are as directors"... and then they just &lt;em&gt;do it&lt;/em&gt;. And they do it in a way where I don't have to triple-check their working, because I know they'll consult the group if they need either technical or emotional support. Like, fuck, I go to work every day now and am just blown away at how bad people are at getting things done. It's extra crazy because &lt;em&gt;one of my team members works at my day job&lt;/em&gt;, and the difference between the version of him that feels ownership of the work and the version of him that blearily clocks in at 9AM could not be more different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we do other weird stuff too - two of our team members didn't do any work on the project. They still get a totally even split. We did some quick thinking on failure modes and incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Splitting the money based on hours worked encourages us to either invite people to work when they're not needed &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; to exclude them when they are needed, and breeds resentment if someone else was more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Splitting it totally evenly means that some people would be encouraged to work less and take their free payday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're both failure modes, but we could just say "Well, if the company dies this way, it dies this way. I trust you all to drop out if you can't put time in."... and that's it. We could accept the risk of doing something totally out-of-the-box, which would never in a thousand years be on the table at my day job, even though they can't go five minutes without saying the word "innovation" while doing exactly what every consultancy is recommending to every organization on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-next-steps"&gt;IV. Next Steps&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know the business won't die as a &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt; failure, but there's so much more to do and learn. There are going to be dozens of points where we are tempted to behave unethically to squeeze money from clients. I've realized that we need a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of recurring revenue for me to salary my friends - an amount that turns a few thousand dollars into a measly drop in the bucket. It's the first time in my life where I've had to seriously start thinking about how to generate numbers in excess of a million dollars &lt;em&gt;per year&lt;/em&gt; with nothing but grit and the people I play board games with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though we're all theoretically totally equal partners, I've been the main driver to this date, and am probably the closest thing we have to a CEO (for now). I now spend a huge amount of time communicating vision and keeping morale up, and that's just with a team of six. A year ago, I thought only absolute scammers said things like "communicating vision", but I get it now... I just also see that most people who &lt;em&gt;say&lt;/em&gt; they're doing it absolutely are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are accountants and lawyers to talk to, so that I don't inadvertently lead my friends into blundering their homes away because we didn't buy the right type of insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows what the future holds?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of relevance here, I'd like to thank everyone who wrote in to advise me or even just say they enjoyed my writing. I won't name everyone because... well, I've responded to &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; email, so you know that I valued the correspondence. The advice helped me avoid so many blunders, and deserves a post on its own. And the emails of support gave me a lot of courage to take the leap into doing this seriously - it's so easy to think that you're the crazy one for finding the corporate environment repulsive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two readers I'd like to call out in particular. There are a few people I'd &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to shill for, but due to the extremely career-threatening tone of the writing here, I ask everyone one-at-a-time whether they'd like to be associated with me. Incidentally, if you've emailed me with &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; advice at all and would like to be seen by the type of person that reads this blog, let me know and I'll add you below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://offermagic.online/"&gt;David Kellam&lt;/a&gt; sat me down, knocked several years of painful mistakes off my career, assisted me in finding a lawyer, then bought me lunch. David, I am sorry, I cannot imagine anything that would vibe less with my audience that the marketing material on that website. But I know with near absolute certainty that you are the master and I am a  humble student, so it is probably the right play for whoever you are targeting. My confidence in David is so high that I'm probably going to spend hundreds of dollars on one hour conversations every time we have a high-value sales meeting coming up, out of my own middle-class pocket, because the expected return makes it a no-brainer. If you run a business, just go talk to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/"&gt;David Gerard&lt;/a&gt; for doing a lot to circulate my writing when it first came out, giving me a lot of excellent advice for a young engineer many months ago, culminating in something I repeat a lot: "Work is work, but the minutes can't be miserable."... and also being the first person with a Wikipedia page to talk to me, which was pretty cool! That does a lot for a young person's confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just realized that 50% of the long list of people I'd want to thank are Davids. Huh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: If anyone knows Patrick McKenzie or Nassim Taleb, hook me up so I can thank them myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v-in-conclusion"&gt;V. In Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to a rooftop bar and got drinks to celebrate our first win, as small as it was. We laughed, drank, and shared a wonderful evening with close friends. We tossed some ideas around for consulting products that were guaranteed to make lots of money, and we gunned them all down because someone would say "I'm only in this to work on projects I believe in, and I don't believe in this".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I made my way home that night, slightly buzzed due to the abysmal alcohol tolerance of a Southeast Asian man that voluntarily wears white shirts to work at the age of 29 and whose perfect evening is tea with a book, I realized that I have no idea what comes next, but there is nothing else I'd rather be doing right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take it easy, and thanks for everything.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/my-company-has-earned-its-first-paycheck/</guid></item><item><title>The Brotherhood of Morons</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/the-brotherhood-of-morons/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Over the holidays, I picked up a book titled &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Basic-Laws-Human-Stupidity/dp/0385546475"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Basic Laws of Human Stupidity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, recommended by Nassim Taleb as a "masterly" work. The introduction to this extremely concise book is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following pages are in fact the result of a constructive effort to detect, know, and thus possibly neutralise one of the most powerful, dark forces which hinder the growth of human welfare and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i"&gt;I.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a running joke with my friends that there is a secret society called The Brotherhood of Morons, a group of malicious individuals committed to the steady erosion of all intelligent decision-making. There has been occasional reference to it in my writing. From a list of my favourite reading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/all-my-favourite-reading/"&gt;There is a Brotherhood of Morons out there in society, and their dimwitted visages curse every standup across the world.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From some reflections after receiving my first truly large batch of reader email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/what-the-goddamn-hell-is-going-on-in-the-tech-industry/"&gt;The first type, my favourite commenters, whose grim-faced no-nonsense corporate visages grace standups across the world. Thanks to their fearless leadership and keen business sense, I have it on good authority that all projects are scheduled to move from red status to green status despite all those risks unfortunately materializing, which is no one's fault in particular. Despite the various challenges we have faced over the years and lack of forward progress, I think this retro is the one where things are going to change.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This frequently felt like it was the most parsimonious explanation for what I was observing in my day-to-day life. Some people don't indicate when they drive, mumble about management methodologies all day, engage in all manner of short-sighted behaviour, and are otherwise obnoxious and dimwitted. The remarkable thing is how &lt;em&gt;similar&lt;/em&gt; they seem to be in their failure. It feels like all these drivers have agreed to be fools in &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the same way, and Agile consultants speak as if they're 10th generation degraded clones of the same buffoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine my astonishment when I read the following excerpt from Cipolla, the book's author, on the very first page, with reference to the stupid:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Darwin we know that we share our origin with the lower members of the animal kingdom, and worms as well as elephants bear their daily share of trials, predicaments, and ordeals. Human beings, however, are privileged in so far as they have to bear an extra load - an extra dose of tribulations originated daily by a group of people within the human race itself. This group is much more powerful than the Mafia, or the Military Industrial Complex, or International Communism - it is an unorganized uncharted group which has no chief, no president, no by-laws, and yet manages to operate in perfect unison, as if guided by an invisible hand, in such a way that the activity of each member powerfully contributes to strengthen and amplify the effectiveness of the activity of all other members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, the Brotherhood is real and they're coming for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-interlude"&gt;II. Interlude&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day after day, with unceasing monotony, one is harassed in one's activities by stupid individuals who appear suddenly and unexpectedly in the most inconvenient places and at the most improbable moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before getting started, I want to say that there are three kinds of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first kind reads about "stupid people" and laughs. Every waking moment of life does not actually consist of blasting swarms of dimwitted suggestions out of the sky like the world's saddest flak battery, but there's something funny about seeing the blueprint for stupid interactions acknowledged. It's the one where you say "We've got too many meetings" and someone says "We should have a meeting to discuss that", or you need resources for an engineering project and someone suggests allocating all the budget to hiring KPMG. Such events can spring with dreary regularity when you're trying to convince a government that you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;, in fact, speak English when you're immigrating, or fall like dumb lightning when you're at a party and someone sincerely says "I think I drive &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; when I'm drunk".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a moment of genuine, stunned confusion every single time it happens, followed by (after enough experience) a gruesome struggle to keep the shit-eating grin off your face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second kind of person reads the quote above and seethes at all those &lt;em&gt;blasted idiots&lt;/em&gt; that don't understand their brilliance, either because they're having a bad day and actually are surrounded by idiots, or because &lt;em&gt;they're the ones&lt;/em&gt; that are difficult to get along with. I've definitely been both at the same time at various times in my life. And to be fair, don't drive when you're drunk, moron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there is the third kind of person who, upon reading anything like the quote above, immediately insists that the complainant &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; secretly be the insufferable one, because actually smart people don't experience frustration for reasons unknown. The implication is that &lt;em&gt;they're&lt;/em&gt; the smart ones because they live in a world where the ultimate marker of intelligence is not the ability to discern sound action from unsound, but instead a grotesque meta-intelligence which manifests as the inexplicable belief that no action is ever deserving of contempt, and any deviation from this belief is a humility problem. Their judgement usually comes with a vomitous attempt at a cutting remark which, coming from individuals best described as a sentient LinkedIn posts, invariably morphs into the flaccid "you aren't as smart as you think you are" or "you sound insufferable".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to take a moment to tell the third group to go fuck themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii"&gt;III.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stupidity is surprisingly difficult to define. Any attempt to do so typically means asserting that the &lt;em&gt;inverse&lt;/em&gt; of that definition is intelligence, an academic debate that will rage on long after the sun has gone cold. Or consider anyone who blunders repeatedly but nonetheless gets promoted - are they &lt;em&gt;stupid&lt;/em&gt; because they weren't able to avoid blundering, or &lt;em&gt;intelligent&lt;/em&gt; because it seems that they still got what they were after? Does it being part of a deliberate strategy matter? There is some serious overloading of the words intelligence and stupidity going on here, and it is unclear what definition of stupidity best equips a person to navigate their actual life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people with a bit of lived experience seem to settle on the conclusion that, barring things such as examining cognitive decline in the course of neurodegenerative disorders, the version of intelligence measured by constructs such as IQ aren't very interesting. In practice, it is &lt;em&gt;not hard&lt;/em&gt; to find all sorts of variants of an "intelligent" person in this sense of the word who are nonetheless committing repeated blunders, and they come in all sorts of flavours. Consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The PhD student volunteering to perform complex technical work at below minimum wage, let me check my Bloomberg terminal, lock themselves into that system?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What Taleb calls the Intellectual Yet Idiot (IYI) - someone who has the mannerisms and interests of a superficially intelligent person but who nonetheless is unable to self-reflect or deal with nuance, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-w-pdqwiBw"&gt;such as the Harvard-educated Ben Shapiro&lt;/a&gt;. They typically are doing at least decently for themselves while making others pay the price for their brand of foolishness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just your generic self-destructive people, such as the kids in my high school that picked up smoking at 14. They're all still intact, but on the whole things aren't going great for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're all foolish in different ways, aren't they? The first group has a lot of intellectual horsepower and respectable moral intentions, but mostly &lt;em&gt;sign up&lt;/em&gt; to be exploited. The second group has no intellectual horsepower by virtue of their horses having been turned to glue long ago, but they're the ones doing the exploiting. And the third group is just making themselves and everyone around them miserable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central premise of &lt;em&gt;The Basic Laws of Human Stupidity&lt;/em&gt; is that you can create useful categories of actors by examining the actions they tend to take, and the rule used to classify them is based on whether the action benefits/harms themselves, and whether it benefits/harm others. This neatly splits actions into four categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An action that benefits everyone involved, termed intelligence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An action that harms oneself and benefits others, termed helplessness (PhDs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An action that benefits oneself and harms others, termed banditry (grifters)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Actions that harm everyone&lt;/em&gt;, termed stupidity (&lt;em&gt;literally anyone&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This definition of stupidity as "an action that harms everyone" has some useful properties - namely, that it &lt;em&gt;actually describes&lt;/em&gt; what I mean when I say "that person is so fucking stupid that they can't be trusted to do anything". For example, I wish Ben Shapiro would shut the fuck up, &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; I know that he would go to bat for me as long as he thought he could sell testosterone supplements as a side-effect. And I feel &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; for most PhD candidates, but I'm not personally harmed being near them. That last category though...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stupid person is a person who causes losses to another person or to a group of persons, while himself deriving no gain and possibly even incurring losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was at a dinner with a few doctors over the Christmas break, and they were regaling each other with stories of two surgeons in the past week who had their careers spontaneously combust because they, during routine procedures with female patients, said something to the effect of "I didn't even have to buy you dinner first" when their patients disrobed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those surgeons &lt;em&gt;became surgeons&lt;/em&gt; so they were obviously intelligent for some definition of intelligence, and that definition &lt;em&gt;isn't useful&lt;/em&gt;. Those guys are &lt;em&gt;idiots&lt;/em&gt;. Get them the fuck away from patients, away from hospitals, away from society, and most importantly, away from me. There is no circumstance under which I could ever trust them to do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;, and there's no way to mitigate being that stupid because it isn't even incentive-driven. They're unfit to clean my boots. They just &lt;em&gt;do things&lt;/em&gt; and bring pain into the world, like hurricanes and scrum masters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stupid creature will harass you for no reason, for no advantage, without any plan or scheme and at the most improbable times and places. You have no rational way of telling if and when and how and why the stupid creature attacks. When confronted with a stupid individual you are completely at his mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the stupid person’s actions do not conform to the rules of rationality, it follows that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) one is generally caught by surprise by the attack;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) even when one becomes aware of the attack, one cannot organise a rational defence, because the attack itself lacks any rational structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what the book is about - those people who, regardless of any other characteristic, just take self-destructive and other-destructive actions repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv"&gt;IV.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people do not act consistently. Under certain circumstances a given person acts intelligently and under different circumstances the same person will act helplessly. &lt;strong&gt;The only important exception to the rule is represented by the stupid people who normally show a strong proclivity toward perfect consistency in all fields of human endeavours.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have, at various points in my life, occupied many of the roles listed above. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been "helpless". Towards the end of my undergraduate qualification in psychology, I signed up for the Australian Honours year, which is basically a slave labour program for universities. I worked tons of night shifts keeping experiments going so that other people could get published. All for no pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to spend as much time as possible being "intelligent", i.e, helping people. I try to be there for my friends, and I think (generally) that the people who've reached out to me over the years have benefited from the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have, I am ashamed to admit, been a "bandit". For a simple example, prior to &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-accidentally-saved-half-a-million-dollars/"&gt;The Snowflake Incident&lt;/a&gt;, I &lt;em&gt;very knowingly&lt;/em&gt; signed up to work at this organization knowing that they'd basically pay me to do nothing other than attend stand-ups and recover from burnout. That's selfishness, through and through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only important exception to the rule is represented by the stupid people who normally show a strong proclivity toward perfect consistency in all fields of human endeavours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But&lt;/em&gt; I and the people that I voluntarily associate with almost &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; behave in a completely self-destructive fashion. And the worst offenders just hammer their faces into the "ruin everything for everyone" button as rapidly as their battered skulls can sustain the beating. I won't waste your time going into great depth with examples, as it would probably be too painfully identifiable if certain people I know ever find my writing, and you've all got examples from your personal lives anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I'll draw the obvious conclusion. When someone behaves stupidly, and you have no evidence beyond their presentation skills that this is a true anomaly, &lt;em&gt;get far away from them&lt;/em&gt;. It doesn't matter how exploitable they seem to be, or how it might benefit you in the short-term, they will eventually self-immolate in a way that will set fire to something you care about. And again, this is very important, &lt;em&gt;presentation skills don't count&lt;/em&gt;, even if they say things that frequently indicate a great awareness of what would constitute intelligent action. The two worst managers I've ever met spoke as if they knew &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; how to run a team, but then did none of the things they said they would do, regardless of how easy it would have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v"&gt;V.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this assertion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probability that a certain person be stupid is independent of any other characteristic of that person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how it naturally pairs with this observation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all human creatures, also stupid people vary enormously in their capacity to affect their fellow men. Some stupid people normally cause only limited losses while others egregiously succeed in causing ghastly and widespread damages not only to one or two individuals but to entire communities or societies. [...] The second factor which determines the potential of a stupid person is related to the position of power and consequence which he occupies in society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I mentioned this to Melbourne's top surgeons at the party mentioned earlier, explicitly asking whether they &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; encounter the same percentage of people who are invariably totally destructive amongst medical professionals, they agreed so emphatically that I asked the question three more times because I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; thought doctors would have a lower dipshit-rate than the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you accept (as a rough rule) that a person is equally likely to engage in totally destructive behaviour regardless of whether they are a prince or a pauper, it naturally follows that some idiots are very important. For many years, I have been astounded that society seems to reward fools more readily than they reward the truly intelligent, a belief which manifested in my demented writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if I think more carefully, this isn't the case at all. Consider the current directors in my department, a large organization with national name recognition. Two of them are intelligent, and it is a privilege to work with them. A few are bandits, though not of the overtly malignant variety - they're just not savvy enough to realize that they're incompetent, so they are unknowing leeches. The remainder are simply stupid. This is &lt;em&gt;approximately&lt;/em&gt; the composition of the organization writ large. The number of people at this organization who dislike their job, their stakeholders, and their salary &lt;em&gt;but don't leave&lt;/em&gt; even though they no longer have the energy to work is astonishing, and that alone is enough to constitute stupidity as per Cipolla's definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason that the stupid leaders of society seem so egregious might not be because of their startling foolishness, but simply because they are stupid in exactly the same proportions as the stock from which they are elevated. Most of us are not so naive as to believe that elevation is meritocratic, but most of us expect that the filter has &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; effect on the distribution of individuals that are moved to power. It probably adds some bandits and removes some of the helpless, we like to think - but perhaps it leaves the stupid totally untouched. And once they're there, every mistake they make is so greatly amplified that it starts to feel like &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; in leadership is a moron. But the people around them are as at their mercy as the rest of us - there is no defense when the stupid attack. Does that sound implausible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus in the following pages I will denote the fraction of stupid people within a population by the symbol σ. [...] One has to keep in mind that according to the Second Basic Law, the fraction σ of the voting population are stupid people and elections offer to all of them at once a magnificent opportunity to harm everybody else without gaining anything from their action. They do so by contributing to the maintenance of the σ level among those in power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAGA, baby!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vi-ludics-law"&gt;VI. Ludic's Law&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite little jokes in engineering culture are things like Hofstadter's Law:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this can't be &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; true, or things would never finish... which I suppose does describe a fair number of projects. In any case, I find them both delightful and useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, these adages describe a type of simple wisdom, which is that you can't understand some things, but an intelligent actor can reason at a higher level around their past failures. For example, I don't &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; know why a lot of my own projects run late, but you'll see a lot of smart people religiously adhere to a rule like "&lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; triple time estimates", and it essentially never backfires. I don't really believe any of the reasons I have for why this works, I just noticed that I get burned whenever I don't do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book comes replete with a couple of these too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-stupid people always underestimate the damaging power of stupid individuals. In particular non-stupid people constantly forget that at all times and places and under any circumstances to deal and/or associate with stupid people infallibly turns out to be a costly mistreake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-stupid people &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; forget the damaging power of stupid individuals. &lt;em&gt;Always&lt;/em&gt;. The author is fully aware that this applies to himself. And consider this rule:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always and inevitably everyone underestimates the number of stupid individuals in circulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the author demonstrates that he's aware that this rule still applies to himself with the following sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The First Basic Law prevents me from attributing a specific numerical value to the fraction of stupid people within the total population: any numerical estimate would turn out to be an underestimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why the author resorts to using σ as a stand-in for the actual percentage of idiots in a population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in the same way that we triple our time estimates, I would propose that a wise person begins by doubling their assessment of how many people are stupid as per the above definition, then tripling their assessment of how much damage such people can do. If this number brings you above 100%, I suggest a moment of quiet reflection re: your life choices and the company they've led you to keep. And in the same way that you never compromise on time estimates unless you're dealing with an &lt;em&gt;incredibly well-known quantity&lt;/em&gt;, you never budge on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, this sort of meta-reasoning is why I do not speculate here on &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; some people are so destructive. I may not understand the causes but, in the same way that I don't really understand why tripling my estimates always seems to work, I just go ahead accept that they're going to ruin everything given the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vii"&gt;VII.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, this book prompted me to carefully consider who I keep for company. While my direct social circle is full of brilliant, compassionate people, I must concede that I spend a fair amount of time dealing with The Brotherhood (mostly at work) without having really spent enough effort to say it was inevitable. I'll be making some moves to rectify this, even if it means having to spend more energy working elsewhere - the risk of a fool destroying our department's budget and putting me out of a job is too high. The easy work isn't worth it, plus I'm always worried that stupidity is contagious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for anyone reading this, I'd encourage them to do the same. And most importantly, if you have a friend that reads this who says that being able to form a social circle full of non-morons is a violation of the "no characteristic predicts stupidity" rule, then your friends are nerds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take it easy, and I hope you're all having an intelligent start to the year.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/the-brotherhood-of-morons/</guid></item><item><title>Merry Christmas, Ya Filthy Animals (2023)</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/merry-christmas-ya-filthy-animals-2023/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;... and a Happy New Year, as I won't be writing until January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed like the natural time to talk about the weirder things I've done in the past two years, how they turned out, what comes next, and most entertainingly, how my employer is almost certainly going to fire me next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selling out (I'd rather call it "compromise")&lt;br&gt;
Is easy to do (sometimes you have to close your eyes)&lt;br&gt;
It's not so hard (being rich is no disgrace)&lt;br&gt;
To find a buyer for you (put on your shoes and join the race)&lt;br&gt;
When money talks (it has a very soothing voice)&lt;br&gt;
You're under its spell (it's up to you to make the choice)&lt;br&gt;
Ah, but whaddya have when there's nothing left to sell?&lt;br&gt;
(Before you know it there'll be nothing left to sell)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2019 to 2022, I played the perfect by-the-books game in life. Coming from Southeast Asia, but being deeply immersed in Western culture through the good old remnants of imperialism, media, and literature, I had the dual qualities that make each of these cultures valuable in the modern marketplace. That is, I was disciplined coming from Asia, and quickly figured out the Western knack for both cunning and fluent bullshit - we have plenty of bullshit in Asia, but compared to the West, we are humble students at the feet of the masters. And in turn, you have much to learn from us about blatant corruption and nepotism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I crushed interviews, picked up the business lingo quickly, took to wearing white shirts, and saved up almost AUD 100K by virtue of my only expensive weakness being that I buy too many books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cunning got me my first real job within 24 hours of starting the search, fluent bullshit allowed me to enter the workforce with no experience on an exorbitant salary AUD 117K, and discipline allowed me to received a 10K raise on average every year. Notably absent from this formula is anything related to producing value for anyone or my beliefs. I suppressed those things, because they weren't compatible with corporate culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my first three years, I saved up AUD 100K without trying particularly hard, &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; losing tens of thousands of dollars to the Australian government's extortionate immigration schemes - fun fact for Australian conservatives by the way! Did you know the Australian government awards points in their immigration scheme for doing a &lt;a href="https://www.monashprofessional.edu.au/professional-year"&gt;year long, AUD 12K course&lt;/a&gt; containing such vital information as how to write emails to white people if you're a stupid brown person like me? I'm sure glad that the government is actually keeping the "bad people" out with their immigration policies, instead of letting elites from other countries buy their way in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, everything was going perfectly. Reasonable work hours, big money, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was absolutely &lt;em&gt;miserable&lt;/em&gt; by 2022. I woke up every day, did mediocre work on projects that were obviously doomed to fail by virtue of the organizations and incentives involved, and eventually found myself unable to work at all. And then &lt;em&gt;no one noticed that I wasn't working&lt;/em&gt;. This culminated in dropping down to three days of work, costing me around AUD 70K a year in total compensation, because I simply couldn't take it anymore. I &lt;em&gt;couldn't&lt;/em&gt;. The thing that broke me was being pulled off the literally lifesaving project I had signed up for to help a ratfuck bastard (an &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; famous one) clean up the SharePoint morass his team had created so he could look better for a promotion. Someone told me in a meeting that I should have called a table &lt;code&gt;Work_Area&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;Work_Site&lt;/code&gt;, and suddenly ludic.exe stopped working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first lesson is being a miserable programmer isn't so bad, because a miserable barber can't afford to cut their work hours like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was worried that giving up so much money was irresponsible. Many people warned me that the grass is always greener, and that unhappy people aren't going to be less unhappy because they've changed their material circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those people were being very reasonable, are right in some cases, and were also totally wrong in this one. It turns out that our monkey brains aren't calibrated for staring at screens for hours at end, writing tedious SQL for reports that no one reads. This is going to sound crazy, but what if reading a book in a cafe is better than that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second lesson (obvious) is that where I spend my time, who I spend it with, and what I spend it on are actually important. When I was younger, I clung to the stoic idea that happiness lies in transcending your attachment to anything beyond your control, including your ability to control your comfort and safety.  The truth so far seems to be that you need to transcend &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; things because life can't be perfect, but you don't have to transcend the pain of ramming knives into your eyes if you &lt;em&gt;stop ramming knives into your eyes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third lesson is for the people that sadly approach me and longingly say they wish they had the same deal. It took me &lt;em&gt;two weeks&lt;/em&gt; to arrange work at three days a week, as a non-FAANG immigrant. Just be &lt;em&gt;smart&lt;/em&gt; about it. Even if you are &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; worse than me, maybe it'll take a year to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-on-my-career-being-doused-in-kerosene"&gt;II. On My Career Being Doused In Kerosene&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received an email this year from a reader titled "Career-Limiting Moves". They talked about their many experiences that aligned with my writing, but wisely put much more effort into remaining anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't always break the rules&lt;br&gt;
People who try are fools&lt;br&gt;
When you get older, maybe then you will see&lt;br&gt;
I've always found ideals&lt;br&gt;
Don't take the place of meals&lt;br&gt;
And that's how it is and how it will always be  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am probably going to lose my job next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been on the front page of Hackernews four times this year, with each and every post being filled with &lt;em&gt;wrongthink&lt;/em&gt;. Several people in my office know I write this blog, which means, no matter how well-intentioned they are, it is no longer a secret. My employer will eventually decide to either contact me directly and ask me to stop writing (and I don't negotiate with terrorists so I'll be forced to leave), or they will restructure and conveniently decide my role is redundant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all likelihood, this blog will blow up a few more times in 2024. My real name will eventually start turning up in searches alongside it - I've already met people who have come across my writing without realizing it was me. At this point, all of the people that Taleb calls "empty suits" will no longer want to work with me, and many of the people that &lt;em&gt;aren't&lt;/em&gt; empty suits but are nonetheless subject to the whims of their vampiric overlords will be too scared to work with me. Some of my professional network will disintegrate, because the worst people will recognize themselves in my writing, and it will be too politically toxic for the good people to associate with me in formal settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My future is in total flux - I don't know what happens after that. I might land in the best roles I've ever seen, working with top-tier programmers solving important problems because I've driven away the people I dislike. Much more likely, I will have to struggle to make ends meet. The people I dislike seem to capture most large enterprises for various reasons - namely, that they're shameless liars. You can't always break the rules, as Tom Lehrer says, but not lying isn't one of the rules he's talking about. The &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; rules are things like "don't embarrass your superiors that appear in tech leadership magazines by writing about how their team wastes half a million dollars in idle Snowflake compute". The bill will come due for all of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I also don't spend my time worrying about whether I'm going to regret all those wasted years on my deathbed, so you know what, the empty suits can &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; go fuck themselves. I'll go to my &lt;em&gt;grave&lt;/em&gt; calling out this waste of human potential, you slack-jawed fucks. You mud-soaked yokels. You absolute midwits. I'd rather work at McDonald's with a bunch of acne-ridden teens than apologize like a housebroken dog. At least someone can eat a burger - I have no idea what the hell the last three years of my work has produced for anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't even know what the lesson is. I guess we'll all find out together, based on whether I resort to blogging from a cardboard box. I'm under no illusion that I wouldn't urgently and gratefully sell out to &lt;em&gt;escape&lt;/em&gt; that cardboard box, but at least I'll have a good reason for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-on-owning-risk"&gt;III. On Owning Risk&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend got a pet rabbit this year, and despite being a dog person, I love this little bastard so much that I was almost conned into buying a $60 bag of hay because I thought it might be healthier for him. I still worry that it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; better for him, because my precious boy is going to go to Harvard and needs the nutrients for his mandated violin lessons. I'd gleefully kill every one of you sons of bitches in cold blood to improve his well-being by a fraction of a percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson for me is that I'm guessing that's about 10% of the intensity of what people feel for their actual children, and that is why I understand that no one is going to bail me out when the secret police come for me. They've got kids, or rabbits, to feed. My readers are wholesome engineers for the most part, not sociopaths running companies with the resources it would take to hire me if I run into difficulty. The system is very much capable of crushing me like a little ant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing to consider, derived from paying attention to the world for thirty seconds, is that sometimes you just get cancer and die. This is a very personal decision and I'd never say that saying no to money is more correct or noble, but I hope that everyone has done the calculations on this one. Things &lt;em&gt;extraneous&lt;/em&gt; to the system are very much capable of crushing me like a little ant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If nothing else, I hope that we all go into 2024 making the courageous decisions that will allow us to meet the inevitable descending boot with the feeling that we had a good run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-on-sacrifices"&gt;IV. On Sacrifices&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's so nice to have integrity&lt;br&gt;
I'll tell you why&lt;br&gt;
If you really have integrity&lt;br&gt;
It means your price is very high  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity to get two grotesquely well-paid jobs this year. One of them was with Shell, where I had a friend almost pass the final interview, and frankly I was basically guaranteed to get it. I still insist that I'm a mediocre programmer at best, but interviews are laughably easy to hack at most companies - theirs was no exception despite being more rigorous than most. They were offering AUD 200K and another 10% bonus on top of that. Enough money that I could buy a house, have kids, buy anything else that I wanted, etc, probably for the rest of my life. My reply was as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for getting in touch. I had a read through the role and was on the fence, but I don't think it's for me at the end of the day. While I'd love to work somewhere with more mature practices than [CURRENT_EMPLOYER], an oil megacorp is a bridge too far for me ethically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offer I spoke about &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/my-wild-experience-interviewing-with-real-engineers/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, which I also rejected on principled grounds, was similarly lucrative. That one was about AUD 200K all up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unlikely I will be approached for any other roles in those salary ranges anytime soon. I have to rely on my network very heavily for such highly paid roles - they don't just come around every day. I'm proud of staying principled, but I also wanted to be clear - it cost me a whole house in one of the most inflated real estate markets in the world. I could genuinely just be &lt;em&gt;rich&lt;/em&gt; now and live in a gigantic property instead of this tiny apartment. Instead, it's the tiny apartment for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have congratulated me on being brave about this. It always feels weird because I didn't feel brave at all. I feel like I didn't really have a choice. How much money are my happiness and soul worth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said no to the money, and I didn't die. I'm still happy. It was a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v-on-improv"&gt;V. On Improv&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of time this year attending improvised theater classes at &lt;a href="https://www.impromelbourne.com.au/"&gt;Impro Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;. They're awesome, and I have met so many wonderful friends doing it. I could not recommend it highly enough. I'd also like to shill for this &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Impro-Improvisation-Theatre-Keith-Johnstone/dp/0878301178"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;. And as far as Impro Melbourne goes in particular, their monthly shows are amazing - if you're in Melbourne, hit me up and I'll go with you! A big goal of mine in the next two years is to perform at an actual event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's another school here called The Improv Conspiracy, and I've been told that it feels super commercial and unpleasant by students who have attended both. Apparently they're very money-oriented, using something I don't understand called the Chicago method, whereas the people I work with at Impro Melbourne clearly have their soul in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson there is pretty self-evident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vi-on-not-talking-if-you-dont-do"&gt;VI. On Not Talking If You Don't Do&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the risk of sounding arrogant - and it should be clear by now that my appetite for risk only grows with every passing day outside the corporate world - I am a very polished speaker, a skill I cultivated in the typical nerd's quest to not have my whole life feel like high school. I have, at many points, been offered the opportunity to speak. Before the interruption of Covid, with a little sprinkling of nepotism, I was scheduled to give a talk at a major medical conference on the applications of artificial intelligence to healthcare practice, an area I have no lived experience in at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with this, I now realize, is that my ability to speak &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; outstrips my life experience. I'm not even 30 yet, but if I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wanted to, I could be on stages talking about how Agile is absolute bullshit and brand myself as some sort of no-nonsense developer advocate. All coming from a guy that has only worked at organizations so incompetent that I've deployed less than 150 lines of code in the past 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to be sick just thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were several points this year where friends pointed out that I could probably transition my blog's success into a lifetime of interviewing people, affiliate marketing, and pandering to middle managers that want to feel like they're still edgy. This is probably true. My most successful writing did about 200K hits in a period of a couple of hours, and I write fast enough that I could have churned out a couple of clickbait titles to capitalize on that. Instead, I write about whatever feels authentic and enjoy the declining numbers as a sign that I'm writing for the right reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing that differentiates me from an Agile snake-oil salesman is not actually technical knowledge, though that's nice. The &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; thing is that I understand that there's no substitute for actual experience. I'm happy to talk about how bad the average organization is at &lt;em&gt;extremely simple&lt;/em&gt; things, like actually using version control or motivating employees, because those are things where there really aren't any serious political obstacles. I would &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; venture that I know how to successfully increase the revenue generated by data functions at an organization, because I've never done that. This is why all my advice in that area is some variant of "just shut down the analytics department lmao". Executives have assured me that this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; achievable, even in countries with strong labour laws, via the judicious application of restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going into 2024, I hope to either succeed with my company, or have it &lt;em&gt;gloriously&lt;/em&gt; explode. In both cases, I'll be able to do something I've really been enjoying, which is writing and talking in an arena where there's no room for self-delusion. We either make money or we don't, but I'll have stories either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vii-on-technical-skill"&gt;VII. On Technical Skill&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My technical skill is still very weak compared to many of the people that write in - I'm no slouch but muscles atrophy from disuse. I've yet to work on a single large project that had a serious effort put into designing, implementing, or maintaining it, let alone ones where this was my primary responsibility. Please note that a &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; effort is not the same thing as &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of effort. &lt;em&gt;A lot&lt;/em&gt; of effort is what you get from ten thousand idiots flailing away at Jira, a &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; effort is what you expect from your surgeon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was expecting my skills to continue weakening relative to my time in industry, but I had much more time to study. I'm only including technical study, because I read a great deal of management material but even the strongest books failed to blow me away in this domain, with the possible exception of the legendary &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mythical Man Month&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I've gone through most of Rich Hickey's talks, which were delightful and gave me a lot to think about. I've since added Jose Valim to the sadly short list of people I look to for programming inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished up about 250 pages of &lt;a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/elixir16/programming-elixir-1-6/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Programming Elixir&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; then put together a fun application with realtime functionality using &lt;a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/overview.html"&gt;Phoenix and LiveView&lt;/a&gt;. It is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; cool, though I must confess that I somehow managed to grok functional programming much more quickly than CSS, which I still don't understand at all. The main thing that struck me, which slots neatly into the previous chapter on the asymmetry between theorycraft and being a practitioner, is how hard design actually is without experience - which is why I advise new engineers &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to waste any time on mediocre organizations. The median organization simply doesn't think about good design at all, only about how to churn out the next feature faster, so you'll end up like me, not having learned a damn thing in years were it not for putting in all that time after hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also able to experience Rich Hickey's assertion that well-designed systems allow you to go &lt;em&gt;faster&lt;/em&gt; over time during this brief foray into web-development, illustrated in this image for those who are unfamiliar.
&lt;img alt="A graph asserting that if you make easy decisions at every juncture, you start faster and become slower over time, whereas if you focus on avoiding overly-entangled systems, you become faster over time." src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/ba12168a.png"&gt;
Almost every time I decided that some element of best practice didn't matter on such a small toy project (though not &lt;em&gt;trivial&lt;/em&gt; due to my low skill in the domain), it inevitably ended up slowing me down later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked through Primagen's &lt;a href="https://theprimeagen.github.io/fem-algos/"&gt;algorithms course&lt;/a&gt; because, I kid you not, my "top 100 globally" university cancelled the postgraduate Data Structures and Algorithms offering due to only &amp;lt; 20 students out of hundreds deciding that was actually worth taking. I remind myself of this fact every time someone says that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law"&gt;Sturgeon's Law&lt;/a&gt; isn't a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following that, I quickly worked through Jay Wengrow's &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Common-Sense-Guide-Data-Structures-Algorithms/dp/1680507222"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to solidify some concepts. That's right, nerds, I  got the title of senior engineer without understanding Big O - &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is how heavily companies factor in being sociable and confident during interviews. It &lt;em&gt;dominates&lt;/em&gt; all other considerations unless you're talking to the 5% of the market that is savvy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year, I am going to finish both of &lt;a href="https://thorstenball.com/books/"&gt;Thorsten Ball's books&lt;/a&gt;, one where you write a compiler and one where you write an interpreter. I will take a bit of extra time out to crunch through &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/How-Linux-Works-Brian-Ward-ebook/dp/B07X7S1JMB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How Linux Works&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I will certainly finish up the excellent &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Fluent-Python-Luciano-Ramalho/dp/1491946008"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fluent Python&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, because while I am slowly developing into an &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; senior engineer and viewing languages as complex tools with varied characteristics suited to handling different problems instead of looking for the One True Solution, a journey greatly accelerated by my introduction to the awesomeness of Erlang's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Telecom_Platform"&gt;Open Telecom Platform&lt;/a&gt;, the typical employer just wants me to do Python magic tricks for no reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also reluctantly complete both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Schema-Complete-Reference-Christopher-Adamson/dp/0071744320"&gt;Star Schema: The Complete Reference&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-data/9781098108298/"&gt;Fundamentals of Data Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, because it is nominally my profession and it would be wise to know the magic incantations that get me more money if I ever need it. In reality, I just Google these things and use my brain for real projects, but that isn't how interviews work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to spend the rest of my time reading totally different things, because life is short and this shit is, fundamentally, for dweebs. I'm certainly going to finish off the whole Taleb collection and otherwise make a dent in my bookshelf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="viii-on-writing"&gt;VIII. On Writing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've met a lot of cool people this year, and I'm going to keep writing so that this keeps happening. It looks like I have sent 167 blog-related emails this year, with only 6 left in my inbox before I reach what passes for Nirvana for adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know if I have that many interesting observations on corporate culture left - it is, largely, a shallow and poisoned pond. There are more important things in life. I'm sure I'll get something out in the area from time to time, but I find myself lower on vitriol every day as I make choices that bring me away from the things I hate and closer to the things I love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also planning to take a two month trip around Europe, where I hope to meet plenty of readers. I have been promised a lunch in Croatia, and I will happily spend &lt;em&gt;thousands&lt;/em&gt; on plane tickets and accommodation to collect. Sorry to the folks in the U.S - that probably has to wait for 2025, as I don't have the energy for back-to-back trips, and also don't want to go through an American airport as a brown, bearded man after all the horror stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ix-on-helping-people"&gt;IX. On Helping People&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are things I want to help my friends accomplish, and they're more important than anything I really want for myself - my wants are very simple. And helping people is a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more fulfilling than printing more money for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023, I helped two friends leave their awful jobs for higher pay and the ability to care for their families more effectively. I advised another two on their job search and provided emotional support, which got them there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am currently coaching one reader into getting his first job, coming from a non-tech background. I love doing this, though I really am not good enough personally to do this for anyone other than an outright beginner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My company is structured such that all six of us get an equal share of profit regardless of the time each person has put into work, an absolutely unscalable structure. It is my hope that, if I crank my brain up to a 1000%, I can generate enough recurring revenue to get them all off the hamster wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I am actively looking to find work for the following three people. Please reach out to me (ludicity.hackernews@gmail.com) if you think you can do anything for them - it would be a great start to the new year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A close friend who is an excellent cybersecurity specialist, located in the U.S. He advises my company and has access to all of our internal comms, so I obviously trust him implicitly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another close friend, coming from a background that involves backbreaking physical labour, located in Ohio. He works harder and is more loyal than anyone I've ever met. I will hard vouch that he will be one of the greatest employees you've ever seen if he is given the chance - any junior role will do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A talented engineer in New Zealand who reached out through the blog, who is facing what seems to me like an extremely clear-cut case of transphobia in the job market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Edit: The first has found a job outside of the blog, and the second has found a job through this blog.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="x-resolutions"&gt;X. Resolutions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lastly, I'm going to get fucking &lt;em&gt;jacked&lt;/em&gt; next year, as I tell myself every year. Have good break, and instead of wishing you luck for 2024, which is what total dorks rely on, I'm going to wish you the courage to put your skin in the game for the things that you want. See you next year!&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 25 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/merry-christmas-ya-filthy-animals-2023/</guid></item><item><title>Performing Technical Responsibility</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/performing-technical-responsibility/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently introduced to the &lt;a href="https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/amet.13218"&gt;following paper on the Australian fire service&lt;/a&gt;, which is an absolute banger. It starts with the following quote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic state of affairs is ignored, to wit, that modern society has no control center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a wonderful piece on ritual and absurdity, against a backdrop of a bunch of people doing their best to save an environment that they love amidst a swirl of panicked politicians, managers, and ground staff, all struggling to balance the fundamental uncontrollable nature of the real world with the various psychological undercurrents that ripple through any large group of people. The thrust of the article is that individuals in these environments &lt;em&gt;perform control&lt;/em&gt;, meaning that they do their best to act as if they are exercising top-down control on an unsettling situation, when in reality things like this are happening:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've got [an analyst] looking at whether to light up this fire break or this fire break, going over the alternatives, weeks and weeks ahead … but meanwhile the ground crew have gone out and lit up the first one and not told us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have a real job, unlike those absolute units out there fighting Australian bushfires, so I can't relate to the part of this where they actually go out there and fix a problem that they care about. What I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; talk about a little bit is this idea of performative rituals, and what I've observed in corporate settings around the rituals that surround a lack of capability. Today's writing is just some reflections on what causes people to flock towards running senseless rituals in offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i"&gt;I.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two ideas are relevant. One, the &lt;em&gt;median&lt;/em&gt; professional seems to be reasonably bad at their job. Two, the usage of rituals and affirmation serves to help people cope with uncertainty, anxiety, and identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the first point, what I mean is that when my friends see psychologists for any reason, the average psychologist seems to blunder so terribly within the first session that said friends usually decide not to continue treatment at all. The average non-tech blog reading engineer seems to struggle immensely with operating Git. The average manager seems to very sincerely struggle with how to trust their team to do anything. The average person in almost any complex field is just... well, not very good. Society would look very different if this wasn't the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this lack of clear competence comes a great deal of neurosis. I just had breakfast with an extremely talented clinical neuropsychologist, a very complex healthcare discipline which can involve the nerve-wracking task of advising a surgeon on which bits of a brain to cut out. It is a fascinating area, and absolutely fraught with the kind of messy reality that doctors are plagued with. As my friend put it, "I've had many sleepless nights, waiting to head into the hospital tomorrow to find out if I made the right call and my patient can still talk post-surgery."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, my friend went on to say that the average practitioner in the field simply &lt;em&gt;refuses&lt;/em&gt; to engage with that messy component of the work, and rapidly flees into the safe, dry, high ground of applying psychological testing frameworks to patients, because now the framework is responsible for the final call, not them. From reading a lot of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Complications-Surgeons-Notes-Imperfect-Science/dp/0312421702"&gt;Atul Gawande&lt;/a&gt;, and more personally, having a father that is considered a world-class surgeon, this is simply not how one practices high-level medicine. Things are messy and that's what a professional is expected to handle. Even when some complexity leaves the field, it migrates somewhere else. I don't know a damn thing about manual memory management because I studied in the era where Python exists, but am instead asked to consider completely different categories of nonsense, and there is no responsible way to escape that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under conditions of both involuntary incompetence &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; anxiety, driven either by the domain itself or personal inability, it is only natural that many people would be driven to feel better. You can train to become more competent, but you might still be anxious, and this is probably the natural state of affairs. And if you simply don't have what it takes to be better for whatever reason or to even understand what is going wrong, the only reprieve lies in addressing the symptom, the feeling of anxiety, i.e, you begin to construct narratives and rituals to feel like you're being responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii"&gt;II.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most organizations that I have observed are obsessed with documentation that no one reads and meetings that no one really benefits from. For some time, I thought this was because the people asking for them were under the impression that these things were actually important. That is, they thought that the documentation was enabling us to more effectively keep track of our decisions (despite being an unsearchable and unmaintained morass) and that the meetings were an effective means of communication information (listen, you've seen what most meetings are like).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;partially&lt;/em&gt; true. But actions can serve manifold purposes, and because we're fundamentally monkeys, the underlying current to a lot of actions is simply emotion management. I have come to suspect that many of the managers I work with schedule meetings because it is what they think a responsible person does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the plight of my current team lead. They are a delightful person, but struggling desperately with not understanding how to manage an engineering team, and even if that wasn't the case, &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; superiors have made enough mistakes that hitting their delivery goals is essentially impossible. From both a workflow and emotional perspective, they do not understand how disruptive it is to interrupt engineers multiple times a day to ask how specific tasks are going. If they did understand those things, it wouldn't make that much difference at this point, because management is denying engineers raises for saving half a million dollars and &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/tech-management-has-bestowed-glory-upon-me/"&gt;giving them $30 gift certificates instead&lt;/a&gt;. That'll make someone work &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; hard enough to not get fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team lead is limited by both his competency as a manager &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; circumstance. Their understanding of what is going wrong is muddled, but what they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; understand is that they are falling behind their commitments to the organization with every sprint, and this is understandably very frustrating. They &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to do a good job, but for whatever reason, they lack competence and the ability to handle that frustration gracefully. And listen, I get it, look at how unhinged my blog is. It has been called many things, but "graceful" is not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing that is immediately apparent to this lead is that for some reason the team only hits half its sprint points every week, which means we fall a little bit further behind our commitments to the organization with every passing week. Things are spiraling, and I suspect that arranging all these meetings and documents feels &lt;em&gt;responsible&lt;/em&gt; as the reaction to what feels like a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, the majority of our leadership has never shipped something that &lt;em&gt;unambiguously&lt;/em&gt; made money for the organization, let alone enough money to pay their own salaries, and I suspect they don't actually know what it takes to generate $200K in revenue. In the most pathological cases, the average career corporate manager seems to be unable to disentangle &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; business value from the fabricated kind on their CV. For example, a very common move I've seen is to predict that a project &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have cost a million dollars, and when those costs never materialize, say that some work you did is what prevented it from happening. I suspect this is either a non-trivial deception for the CFO to see through, because sometimes preemptive cost-saving is a real thing, or that it isn't worth the political effort to contest these analyses because it would require some sort of technical audit. In any case, some people &lt;em&gt;literally have no experience&lt;/em&gt; delivering results that aren't of this entirely fake variety, but also believe what they're saying about their previous performance - it is easier to lie about results than to get results, and it is easier to appear confident when you believe your own lies, and confidence is well-regarded in interviews, so we select for self-deception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine how &lt;em&gt;stressful&lt;/em&gt; it would be to try deliver results in a field where you have no idea what the hell you're doing? Like literally no idea? I remember my first day as an engineer, where I was sat in front of a horrendously structured Oracle database and told to try to produce a report. I was well-supported, but I was &lt;em&gt;anxious&lt;/em&gt;. I hadn't written any SQL in a real codebase, I didn't understand the domain, I didn't know what information was useful to the stakeholder, and I had no idea how to tell if the dashboard looked good. At least as a fresh engineer, people had patience for me. A lot of our directors &lt;em&gt;never moved beyond that level of understanding&lt;/em&gt;, and that is why they're shipping GPT chatbots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you've built a whole career out of this, they've got no idea what they're doing, much like the psychologists who drive away their patients during the first session, but they've been told what a responsible manager &lt;em&gt;superficially&lt;/em&gt; does. So they do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They've heard that modern teams run standups, so they run standups with no ability to judge if it is actually producing the outcomes they want. Huge volumes of documentation are produced, with no intuition or understanding of &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; documentation would actually be useful to day-to-day operations. While there are no &lt;em&gt;operational&lt;/em&gt; improvements from doing all of the above badly, it at least produces the feeling of &lt;em&gt;doing something&lt;/em&gt;, and in particular, something a manager is supposed to do, whatever that means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii"&gt;III.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't prepared a punchy takeaway or useful intervention here. The truth is, I have basically no ability to make these people see what they're doing, as per that old saying around not relying on people to understand things when their income relies on their continued incomprehension. The only thing I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do is determine whether I'm actually being responsible myself, then try to behave accordingly. I have two very simple litmus tests for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is whether I'm getting the results I want. If I'm getting good results, I'm &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; being responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more interesting case is when I'm &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; getting results, and I want to be sure that I'm actually doing my best. My test here, in accordance to the above, is literally whether I'm &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; doing what everyone else is doing. Doing something weird means I'm &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; being responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By way of example, when I graduated, I desperately needed a job in the first world so that I wouldn't have to return to my home country. I had seen a lot of people try and fail to find work, because Australian companies largely just throw your CV out as soon as they see you aren't a permanent resident. This really isn't that big a deal, as a good engineer is worth handling a little bit of visa drama if you want them around when their temporary visa expires in two years, but HR doesn't care about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd spent a long time watching international students send out application after application, only to get rejected every single time. They would then complain for ages about how discriminatory the country is, so on, so forth. I mean, all fair points, but it was also clear that they were simply applying so that it wasn't their fault they couldn't find work. They did what they were supposed to, right? I got my first job in 24 hours, starting at about AUD 100,000, and frankly not actually being a very good engineer - I was still in the can't-use-Git phase of my career, thank you academia!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How? I bypassed HR. I started digging up the names of the most senior engineer (someone who would suffer from an incompetent hire), cold contacting them, and talking about the job before applying. This was enough to get me interviews, and took me about a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the typical person turns up to an interview and wings it, especially as a fresh graduate. I hired a professional interview coach for two hours at the recommendation of a family member, and I have absolutely dominated the competition in every interview I've sat since then, at least on the behavioral components. It was &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt;, but it worked. Hell, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jameslynchinterviewucan2/?originalSubdomain=au"&gt;here's the coach&lt;/a&gt;, buy this for your kids when they graduate. Nothing revolutionary to an industry veteran, but this prevents young people from wasting their first few valuable interview opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stuff &lt;em&gt;feels weird&lt;/em&gt;. I felt like a weirdo sending those cold contacts out into the world - couldn't I just send CVs comfortably into the void? It felt even weirder spending like $300 for an hour of interview practice, even though it was super obvious. At an Australian engineer's salary, the interview would only have to save me &lt;em&gt;one day of job searching&lt;/em&gt; to be a net positive. Is there &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; universe where a graduate wouldn't benefit from even mediocre interview preparation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just trusted my model of the world and took action, and it turns out that in many domains, that action &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; weird. People ask me all the time how I do anomalously well in some domains (you'll just have to trust that I'm not being an immodest jerk here), and I link them to the resources I use, and then they proceed to &lt;em&gt;not read or do any of them&lt;/em&gt;, because actually reading on salary negotiation or psychology is unusual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take it back, I do have a punchy takeaway. Being weird is a sign of life.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/performing-technical-responsibility/</guid></item><item><title>Tech Management Has Bestowed Glory Upon Me</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/tech-management-has-bestowed-glory-upon-me/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I wrote about &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-accidentally-saved-half-a-million-dollars/"&gt;saving my employer about half a million dollars&lt;/a&gt; by clicking a few buttons in Snowflake. In it, I expressed a lot of cynicism around the likelihood of my employer rewarding me. I had reached out to the most senior person in my organization outside of the executive heading our department to ask for more money, and received total silence in response for several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I've promised to always be honest in my writing here, and the truth is that I was wrong on this one. I predicted $0 or $5K, and they did a lot better than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won the 'Innovation' award at the annual meeting I deliberately skipped today, which comes with a $30 gift voucher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i-retiring"&gt;I. Retiring&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, firstly, I obviously don't really need to blog anymore or keep my company running on the side - I mean, look, no offense to most of my readers, but I really don't have &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; to talk to people that aren't in the upper class with me. You understand. I suspect a few of you have won some equally prestigious trophies - maybe some sort of participation award from a primary school running event, or a box juice for being an extra good boy today - and we'll continue to share some delightful conversations, but the rest of you are just going to have to move on. Find someone closer to your level, financially, morally, sexually, and spiritually speaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some quick napkin math reveals that I simply need to save about $2.2 billion dollars annually to maintain my current lifestyle, so really, I'm basically retired. All I've got to do is swing by every company on the planet running Snowflake and turn the compute timeout number from 10 minutes to 1 minute, and that'll cover me for all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't figured out what I'm doing 2025, because apparently Snowflake's annual revenue is only $2 billion, so they'll be broke by the time I'm done, but I can probably find some sort of other button to turn more computers off. Maybe some sort of nuclear launch code, I'm still think - sorry, I mean innovating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-gratitude"&gt;II. Gratitude&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let it be known that I have not forgotten my friends. While I am obviously the swiftest, bravest, and dare I say more virile engineer in this hemisphere, it would be remiss of me not to thank the people that helped me get here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I would like to thank the absolute dipshit consultants that left the compute timeouts set to the wrong number. Without your continued and reliable incompetence, it would have been impossible for me to click the three buttons necessary to be deemed the most innovative man in a department that constantly talks about how innovative it is. Can you imagine how &lt;em&gt;powerful&lt;/em&gt; I must be? How omnipotent? God, with this award I could obliterate the career of any fool that dared to contradict me - the merest expression of disapproval would leave anyone in &lt;em&gt;tatters&lt;/em&gt;. Your hairdresser won't even talk to you for fear of incurring my wrath, and that concern would be justified. Even one of the Uninnovated (as I like to call them) understands that it would be the height of folly to tangle with a man that could pay for half of an expensive haircut without so much as &lt;em&gt;blinking&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I would like to thank the managers that allowed this to happen, and then covered it up shamelessly. If it weren't for your constantly falling asleep at the wheel and then trying to desperately save face at the last minute, I might have been given an actual raise instead of this beautiful, precious electronic congratulations letter. Of course, with more money I might have been able to purchase a house or take care of a loved one, but those aren't sufficiently aligned with the institution's partners that assist in the gamification of rewards, and because management has judged that I have the brain of a particularly stupid toddler and management is never wrong, I will act accordingly. Thank you all so, so much. I will be retiring to my crib shortly, jamming square blocks into round holes like the rest of you drooling imbeciles, preparing for elevation to perhaps... a $40 gift card? No, no, I should be grateful for what I have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to thank the actually competent engineers on my team for nothing, you useless bastards. You absolute clowns. God, you make me sick. All those ETL failures that you painstakingly diagnosed and troubleshot before our stakeholders threw a fit and sent management to the data gulag? It's all dirt beneath my boot. You're all little ants to me, and that's why none of you got raises &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; you didn't get an Innovation award. In a way, I pity you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go back to "writing unit tests" and "diagnosing query performance issues". Christ, it's good that we work in such a low-functioning environment, because you're all so soy that any heat and pressure would straight up turn you into tofu. If you actually innovated - like me, by explicitly ignoring management's orders and providing unauthorized production system access to new hires - you'd be on my level, but you didn't, so you're not. I'd step on you on my way to the top, but you'd probably like it, you degenerate animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't talk to me. Don't even &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; at me, you &lt;em&gt;losers&lt;/em&gt;. Ugh. &lt;em&gt;Ugh&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-to-the-losers"&gt;III. To The Losers&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of losers, at the risk of actually getting in trouble at work, I'd like to console the team that genuinely was competing for this award and lost. We have a data science department, the department that I left to become a data engineer because we weren't producing enough of value, and they almost won with their... let me check my notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah. That's very innovative and I'm sure that no one has done this before. This probably isn't the project that our actually competent lead data scientist said is garbage and they want nothing more to do with it, but the whole year was spent on it, is it? Oh, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; that one? That idea, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars in engineering time, lost out to me turning the number '10' to '1'? The one that, and this is entirely true, crashed within a few minutes of launching because the I.T department you handed it to sent it to all 10,000 employees but didn't put up a load balancer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sucks to suck, nerds. Typing in &lt;code&gt;import openai&lt;/code&gt; was &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; an inferior solution to mine, as yours had more characters in it and is thus more tech debt, you stupid buffoons. Fuck, it's just so &lt;em&gt;sad&lt;/em&gt; that you thought you could compete with me. But you aren't CTO material so you wouldn't know that, whereas I am, and my second innovation in this new era is going to be shooting your dead weight out of an airlock. Ejecting ballast is the mechanism that will propel this organization into the future, which we'll need to do in order to recoup the devastating $30 lost we've just incurred. That's just the price of retaining top talent, baby, and one day, assuming you survive the freezing vacuum of space, you too might experience the financial freedom of being able to buy three large microwave pizzas without thinking twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come back in ten years, when you've trained hard enough to get as good as me - but again, you're going to be competing with my massive war chest, so I wouldn't get my hopes up if I was you. I could run the smallest tier of managed Postgres instance for slightly over a week without breaking a &lt;em&gt;sweat&lt;/em&gt;, and at some point you just have to acknowledge that there is a level of resourcing that no one can reasonably compete with. Frankly, this isn't even a fraction of my power - in theory, I could stop up to three Snowflake warehouses from idling all day a minute, so I might actually be one of the most valuable people on the &lt;em&gt;planet&lt;/em&gt; right now. I don't really want to spend time with Musk and Bezos, but I guess they're the only people who understand my financial position now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's lonely at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-whats-next"&gt;IV. What's Next?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking about getting into angel investing and philanthropy. Not to brag, but since I know I can generate infinite money basically on a whim, I'm willing to throw the entirety of my functionally &lt;em&gt;limitless&lt;/em&gt; riches into a single venture of my choosing, and am open to reader ideas. The Ludic Fund is willing to invest in anything that is going to bring about sufficient social good that is within our considerable budget, such as a particularly big plate of pasta, assuming that you can demonstrate that the idea can scale (how many people could this pasta feed?) and that you've got the technical competence to execute flawlessly (are you smart enough to salt your pasta?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v"&gt;V.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will never not be appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="An image of a scorpion sitting on top of a frog which is drowning. The frog is saying &amp;quot;Why did you sting me? Now we will both surely drown.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Lol&amp;quot; said the scorpion &amp;quot;Lmao&amp;quot;." src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/7d29de7d.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 08 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/tech-management-has-bestowed-glory-upon-me/</guid></item><item><title>Praise The Machine Spirit</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/praise-the-machine-spirit/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;We're trying something new today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i"&gt;I.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swirling, putrid-green heavens begrudgingly opens its yawing maw and unleashes a lazy torrent of acid-rain-drool upon the slowly awakening inhabitants of Valadia IX. The deluge of thick droplets sizzles through the air, splashing against fortified architecture and sliding slug-trails along the sides of buildings before eventually terminating either in a sizzle against the blackened ground, or coming to rest, indolent, atop the thrice-waxed leaves of the native flora. Every year, about twenty tourists are dissolved as they foolishly jostle the trees and are engulfed by the remnants of the last storm. However, they are the type of tourist stupid enough to think that a trip to Valadia IX would be "fun" and "an experience", so they are seldom missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a little background for those in the audience for are unfamiliar with the setting that our drama will unfold in. It is the 41st millenium. Humanity, despite spanning untold galaxies, is in a perpetual war for survival against the forces of Chaos, demonic, Lovecraftian spirits that exist in the Warp, a wretched place beyond space and time, that seek to corrupt their eternal souls. The main thing standing against the tides of madness are the Imperial Guard, trillions of soldiers and heroes, the posters say, laying down their lives for the good of all humanity and their immortal God-Emperor enshrined upon his life support system - the Golden Throne - on Terra. The only way to explain how important the God-Emperor is to humanity is that spreadsheets are not allowed near the Golden Throne's systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the posters don't usually talk about is the incomprehensibly large logistical machine required to ensure the (relatively) smooth operation of a billion battlefronts. And the supporting systems, run out of millions of offices scattered throughout the Imperium, where information is processed to ensure the effective persecution of the eternal war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is in one such office that we find Gregory "Greg" Xavanto, blinking bleary-eyed at the screen of his cogitator while he sips at this recaf, pausing occasionally to stretch and glance out the glasscrete windows to observe the rolling yellow-green waves of bile scouring the planet's surface. There are two risks to any mortal who pursues the war against Chaos - the risk to the body and the risk to the soul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The door behind him opened up, accompanied by the usual "Good morning, everybody! Working hard or hardly working, am I right? Because hardly working is a violation of Penal Code 3.1, an affront to our glorious Emperor, and I'll have to have you executed, haha! Just kidding!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg was currently fighting for his soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry Talls was actually a pretty good person, if you really like bad people. No one understood exactly &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; he had come to be in charge of this branch of the Departmento Munitorum, but all the most experienced staff had left within the first two years of his tenure. All his superiors seemed to be &lt;em&gt;aware&lt;/em&gt; that he was absolutely incompetent, but he would fly into such hysterics at the slightest sign of being contradicted or embarrassed that they had simply decided to hope he just sort of... went away on his own. Each morning, he would cheerfully greet the team the same way, and his personal  &lt;em&gt;Oblivious&lt;/em&gt;-class refractor field would disperse the veritable lasgun barrage of insincere, forced smiles, where a more clueful man would simply be incinerated on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hey, Greg!" Harry said, "just wanted to have a quick report on those Basilisk firing solutions for the landholder on Aranis V!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg braced himself harder than an autocannon operator, saw Sash across the room mouthing "May the Emperor be with you." and turned to face Harry. Scorching las-smile delivered. Neatly deflected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry wiggled his eyebrows and said, "So, got them ready for me? I promised them to the field artillery officer a month ago, and we're already two weeks overdue." Harry had a way of saying &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; that everyone instantly understood to mean &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hi Harry. Yes, as I've said before, there have been some complications. I wish you had consulted me before promising -"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry opened his mouth to say something no doubt charged with Chaos energy, and Greg hurried along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"- anyway, look, the external team on Mars says they still have a massive backlog of work, and won't even be able to ship the news barrels for another month, let alone get time on the hypercogitation cluster to calculate the new firing solutions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry considered this very briefly, decided it was inconvenient, and chose to ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Greg, listen, you know I have an immense respect for your work -"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I - wh —"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But Greg, we really need some time to talk about your attitude on this whole thing."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You —"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No, Greg, let me finish. I appreciate that this is difficult, but I don't want to hear about problems &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; I want to hear solutions! You all know I'll happily accept any personal criticism and I, in fact, invite it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But the code your tech-merc wrote is—"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Greg, this isn't the time to hear about me - we're discussing your performance. Just... get it done, all right? And pencil in a bit of time on your chronolog for a meeting tomorrow evening - don't worry, I'm sure we'll be able to sort these performance issues out - but I have found this conversation very frustrating."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry glanced at his chronometer as Greg gaped like a Sivalian eel-hawk, floundering desperately for something to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Look, this has been a great chat, but I've got a meeting with the Chief Techpriest. Have a good day, okay, and have that firing solution ready by the end of today? Perfect, thanks."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh no, here it comes. Harry proffered a clenched hand for his customary fist bump. He seemed to think it was an endearing quirk - imagine the head of the planetary munitorium going for a &lt;em&gt;fist bump&lt;/em&gt; instead of a firm handshake, how positively &lt;em&gt;congenial&lt;/em&gt; - and he was &lt;em&gt;relentless&lt;/em&gt;. He would stand there, fist outstretched, as the painful seconds ticked by with all the exquisite torment of a chainsword sawing through limb, until the sheer force of his manic smile and unflinching awkwardness forced you to reciprocate. Harry loomed over Greg now, his knuckles as inviting as those of a &lt;em&gt;Mezoa&lt;/em&gt; Pattern Power Fist threatening to blast an opponent into a fine red mist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg held out for three seconds before offering a tepid bump. The moment of contact felt like he just had his soul crushed underfoot by an Imperial Titan. Harry's smile could only be described as demonic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Awesome! See you!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry sauntered away to harass someone else. Greg prayed to the Emperor for protection, and dialed into Mars to find out if there was &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; way he could get them to do their damn jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii"&gt;II.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is 25:34 planetside on Aranis V, and Sergeant Mertol is currently sheltering in a trench while a searing volley of lasgun fire scorches lethal trails of ozone overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Private Malley, what the &lt;em&gt;gakk&lt;/em&gt; is taking so long? For the love of the Emperor, &lt;em&gt;level that gakking bunker&lt;/em&gt;! Why can't those gakking idiots drop an Earthshaker round on those heretic bastards already?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can hear the explosive crumple of steel as their abandoned Imperial tank detonates somewhere behind them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Sir, they say it's the design of our backend!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What the &lt;em&gt;gakk&lt;/em&gt; does that mean, Private?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Sir, I don't know, Sir!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You tell those &lt;em&gt;gakking&lt;/em&gt; idiots that —"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new voice cuts across the chaos of battle, and all the guardsmen within the trench fell silent, including Sergeant Mertol, whose presence was best noted by his peers by the string of shouted obscenities that trailed behind him like an uncouth cloak. But when an Imperial commissar speaks, all around them are silent. The sight of their peaked caps and imposing greatcoats came with a reputation so dire that soldiers would sooner face the enemy than risk an accusation of cowardice from a commissar, alongside the customary summary execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, Commissar Valera was beloved by the troops, having never resorted to violence directed against the enlisted, and was a figure who ruled through inspiration rather than fear. Still, the silence that reigned was tinged by a patina of unease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hold the line, Sergeant. I have some familiarity with such matters from my previous occupation. I will return within the day."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valera ducked into a nearby tunnel system, stopping to grab something from a nearby crate, and was gone. The troops huddled around the sergeant, who looked perplexed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Trooper Tallor, you've taken drinks with the commissar on occasion. What did the commissar do before their appointment?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They said they were a 'sysadmin' on Holy Terra, sir. I don't know what that is."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Huh."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They all stared into the tunnel for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Sergeant, why do you think the commissar grabbed a rack of boltgun rounds on her way out?" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii"&gt;III.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far, far away, in a considerably more genteel setting - Mars, the greatest Forge World in the Imperium - the war is being waged very quietly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nutritional Supply Depot 434 (a cafeteria) is a perfect reflection of its customers. Perfectly sterile, perfectly uniform grey tiles, polished to a perfect sheen, with thousand of meticulously braided wires running along the ceiling. There is only one item on the menu, doled out in precise quantities by a bewildering array of mechanical arms, nutritionally perfected slab - a literal cube of gray... something. Guardsmen eat it reluctantly, but the techpriests of the Cult Mechanicus &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; the local preparation of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Techpriests enjoy two things - being as far from the frailties of the flesh as possible, and the appropriate care of machinery. Slab accomplishes the former by being nutritionally adequate and disgusting, but Techpriest Gunther is pushing his around his plate distractedly with one of his six mechanical tendrils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whine of servos signals Techpriest Jalla sliding in to sit opposite him. Jal pushes her slab around too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Gunther breaks the silence, his raspy, mechanical voice sounding like it's issuing from the masked faces of twelve Krieg shocktroopers speaking in unison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Got a call from Valadia IX again."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Same one?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yes. Command will not authorize any techpriest time to maintain the divine command sets upon the Valadian artillery platforms."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glumly, one of Gunther's tendrils forked a perfect cube of slab into his mouth. Amidst his depression at the idea of a cogitator being maintained poorly, it tastes absolutely bland, so that was good at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jalla hissed, pushing her plate away from him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I can't stand it for another minute, Gunther. Think about it! If we don't get those fools to tend to the blessed Machine Spirit, all those guardsmen are going to die!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"And then who is going to worship the machines?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Exactly!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They seethed together for a while, tendrils flailing and flexing erratically, looking like two livid octopi. Around them, it was dead silent apart from the sound of servitors slicing and dicing slab into perfect geometric shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Gunther, did you ask &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; we can't just write a quick script? It would take but a day —"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They said that they had already promised the Warmaster a thousand  boltguns for the space marines, and we can't work on the Basilisks until they have a jam rate lower than 0.001%!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But - but - they said I can't work on the boltgun jams either!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yes, because they've promised the Warmaster a fleet of &lt;em&gt;Mars&lt;/em&gt;-class Battlecruisers before the end of this solar year, and we're scheduled to finish in eight solar years."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jalla was grateful that she had long since replaced her blood with a more efficient chemical slurry, because flimsy human veins were only rated for about a tenth of the pressure currently being exerted against her carbo-synthoid circulatory system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But they won't let me work on —"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gunther waved a resigned tendril at Jalla, silencing her. "I know. I know."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They finished their slab in silence. Gunther thought that he detected the mildest hint of seasoning, which only served to make a bad day worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You know Gunther, I spoke to Master Augustus last week, the lead Techmarine of the Blood Angels. He told me that he hasn't missed a project deadline in a hundred and forty three years, and all the cogitators in his Chapter have never experienced any downtime - ever. And command never contradicts his maintenance orders."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By the Omnissiah, how is such a thing possible?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"He can crush ferrocrete with his bare hands and carries a &lt;em&gt;Baal Pattern Mark IV&lt;/em&gt; power sword at all times."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ah."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv"&gt;IV.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The backline of Aranis V was a sodden, disgusting field of churned mud and filth, all amidst the concussing din of shouted commands and mortar fire. The weather on Aranis V cycled between twenty second bursts of intense, freezing rain, punctuated by about thirty seconds of howling gales so intense that they stole the breath away, finally giving way to tropical stillness and a humidity so thick that the guardsmen almost wanted to requisition aquatic combat gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They somehow &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; got the local variant of mosquitos amidst this madness, which Commissar Valera thought was just plain unfair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had emerged from the Imperial tunnel network about an hour ago, and was now (barely) sheltered from the elements in Archlord Macavian Duratel's command tent, sipping a tin filled with recaf so acrid that it was probably a rights violation to serve it to prisoner's of war, but she was a friendly officer so that was probably all right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lone mosquito had somehow drowned itself to death in the recaf, and Valera was determinedly trying to sip from the tin in short bursts, lips pressed taut against the rim of the vessel in a desperate attempt to keep the bug out. She was also arguing with Macavian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archlord Macavian Duratel had a reputation amongst the troops as being a reasonable man to work for. He thought clearly, treated them well, and listened to complaints. The only major flaw that the man had was that he only had a good command of High Gothic, spoken by nobles, and required the aid of a servitor to translate more complicated words for him. It hovered in the air next to him now, a floating skull with a nobleman's cap wedged firmly upon its head. Both the Archlord and the servitor were wearing truly glorious golden monocles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Commissar, I'm afraid that while I understand that the offensive has stalled and can't proceed without those firing solutions, I have been assured by my command staff that we are simply looking at another few days before we're able to lay fire at the coordinates you're requested through these weather conditions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of guardsmen units swore in languages that conveniently avoided offending the sensibilities of local command and blog readers, opting to drop in replacements from the planets from which they were mustered from. For example, Valera's previous troop used &lt;em&gt;gak&lt;/em&gt;. Unfortunately, Valera was from Holy Terra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's simply unacceptable. It would take ten minutes to punch a script to sort this out in fucking Python if your infrastructure was halfway reasonable."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macavian looked utterly perplexed. "What in the name of all that is Holy do gravcars have to do with —"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The servitor floated slightly closer to his ear and, in a perfectly monotone, synthesized voice said, &lt;strong&gt;"with respect sire, you are recalling the tollaqa word &lt;em&gt;fitone&lt;/em&gt;, which has come to mean a modern gravcar following the sabbat crusades. commissar valera is referring to an ancient terran programming language called &lt;em&gt;python&lt;/em&gt;."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ah! Ah. Ahhhh." Macavian sounded like a stressed vampire working his way through a particularly enlightening mathematics lecture. "Commissar, you know that prior to having to prosecute this war, I ran a tight ship with the factories and manufactoriums here."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valera bobbed her head in agreement. The mosquito just bobbed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I did that by trusting my command staff," he continued, "and they have assured me that there's no way that this can be accomplished within the next three sprints."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Sprints? Do your managing engineers require battlefield transportation? I can arrange an escort within a solar cycle."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ah, no. It's more of a, uh —" he looked for the word and failed. "A sprint is one, two, or four weeks, depending on the team that I'm talking to, and they've assured me that this is the most effective way to deliver software. It ensures everything will be delivered on time, with plenty of warning in the rare cases where this isn't going to happen."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valera slammed an open palm against the table, causing the mosquito to bob even more violently in agreement. "Then why the &lt;em&gt;fuck&lt;/em&gt; is everything late?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confusion. "We can of course get you more recaf, commissar, but —"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;with respect sire, you are thinking of the ancient terran word &lt;em&gt;latte&lt;/em&gt;, meaning recaf. the commissar is using the word &lt;em&gt;late&lt;/em&gt;, meaning not within the bounds of a previously agreed upon schedule"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ah! Ah. Ahhhh. Commissar, you know that I have little understand of these programming issues. But I've been assured that this is the best method to run such an operation, so I have largely concerned myself with logistics."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"How did you run the manufactoriums, Archlord? In &lt;em&gt;sprints&lt;/em&gt;?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Er, no. Well, we tried a few things, and they all didn't really make much difference, if I'm being honest. My best people delivered consistently and honestly, and I had to have the worst transferred. I never worked out a better method for delivering than that, I'm afraid."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valera stared at the Archlord for a long moment - long enough to make him uncomfortable. With some delicacy, she reached into the tin of recaf and picked out the offending mosquito, placing it upon the table. To her surprise, it began to stir and right itself. She slammed the remainder of the scalding recaf so quickly that it made the Archlord wince, checked that her bolt pistol was still loaded, and hurried her way to the exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mosquito buzzed out ahead of her, hopefully to bite a non-technical project manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Where is engineering command operating out of?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Valadia IX."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm going to visit those motherfuckers, and may the Holy Emperor watch over them."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macavian beamed as the commissar strode off in the direction of his command staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well, that went well, wouldn't you say? Really turned that one around, eh?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;with respect sire, you are thinking of the gulani word &lt;em&gt;motarfak&lt;/em&gt;, which means revered spirit. the commissar was using the term &lt;em&gt;motherfucker&lt;/em&gt;, which means -"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v"&gt;V.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the end of the "stand up", which Valera had graciously been invited to. They did it sitting down, which was her first clue that one of the Chaos Gods was involved. It had been scheduled for fifteen minutes, and they were getting near the end of the first hour. The managers seemed very pleased with themselves, puffed up with self-importance. By her calculations, she had probably lost another twelve troopers under her command in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the details were lost on her, and this, she suspected, was because the people that were talking the most had no idea what on Terra they were talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was carefully thumbing the safety off her bolt pistol under the table. Harry was talking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well, that was a productive session. I'll let the Archlord know that the Basilisk solutions will be delayed a further few sprints. And Greg, could you chastise the machine spirit?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You know, hit it so that it knows to stop misbehaving."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's not how - yes, Harry. Sure. I'll get right on that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Great! Oh, and I know we've gone a bit over, but could you—"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry was cut short by the bark of a bolt pistol, which sent his body tumbling to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stunned silence. All faces turned to Valera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bolt pistol barked out four more times as staff dove for cover. One of the worst offenders sprinted for the door, only to be cut short by Valera's chainsword. A man and a woman ducked for the door right after she cut that one down, and she let them both go because they had rolled their eyes at a few points during the meeting - still untainted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quivering in terror, a woman in full command regalia drew herself to her full height on the other side of the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What is the &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt; of this, commissar? I'll have you shot!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The click of a new bolt magazine being loaded into the pistol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You had a Tzeentch cult operating right under your nose and you're going to have &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; shot?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A Tzeentch cult? What are you talking about?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzeentch was one of the horrific Chaos Gods, notorious for warping human ambition with galaxy-spanning plans, sometimes operating over thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You all but admitted it! You all worship the subdaemon Scrum."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman slumped in relief. A misunderstanding. They would make it out of this alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Commissar, no! It's a management methodology! Scrum is a framework to help you implement Agile—"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valera fired five rounds into her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Oh. That's much worse."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She turned the gun on the rest of the room, firing a total of eleven times, with the weapon jamming on the twelfth shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Imperial bolt pistol is a marvel of human engineering. They fire .75 caliber explosive "bolts", with single shots capable of eliminating basically any soft target and many hard targets. Due to their extreme expense, they are maintained meticulously, and Valera maintained hers better than most. A typical bolt pistol jams around one in every ten thousand rounds, and Valera's jammed once in every hundred thousand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She stared at Greg, who stared back, slack-jawed and pale. She cleared the jam and fired at him again. Jam. Another clear. Another jam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowly, she lowered the weapon. Maybe the machine spirit recognizes its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Just... just get the guns firing, okay? You're in charge now."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"O-okay."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v_1"&gt;V.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a solar day, Valera was back with her squad, watching alongside Sergeant Mertol, as all the enemy positions within a hundred kilometers are smashed into a grey dust by hundreds of Earthshaker rounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vi"&gt;VI.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals willing to defy convention and perhaps even ethics and the law to pursue their intellectual ambitions often make willing and effective servants. Some thinkers who reach a stumbling block in their scholarly pursuits can become obsessed with a particular problem or question. These scholars may try any number of approaches to find answers, but no experiment, no amount of research or consultation with experts, and no amount of sweat and elbow grease brings them closer to a solution. These obsessed scholars are particularly vulnerable to Tzeentch’s temptations. While some may deliberately seek the assistance of the Master of Fate, many more unwittingly fall into Tzeentch’s service after accepting help from an insightful but mysterious new colleague or after &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Scrum-Jeff-Sutherland/dp/038534645X"&gt;gazing too long at a classified or forbidden text that somehow finds its way onto their desk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tome lies gathering dust on Harry's desk, and no one remembers how it got there, even after an Inquisitorial investigation. The Inquisitor locks it in a hyperbaric duravault, banned for anyone with less than Vermilion level clearance, noting that to merely read the cover would corrupt the ambitious instantaneously with its impossible promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, historians may look back on human progress and draw a sharp line designating "before Scrum" and "after Scrum." Scrum is that ground-breaking. It already drives most of the world's top technology companies. And now it's starting to spread to every domain where leaders wrestle with complex projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've ever been startled by how fast the world is changing, Scrum is one of the reasons why. Productivity gains of as much as 1200% have been recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book you'll journey to Scrum's front lines where Jeff's system of deep accountability, team interaction, and constant iterative improvement is, among other feats, bringing the FBI into the 21st century, perfecting the design of an affordable 140 mile per hour/100 mile per gallon car, helping NPR report fast-moving action in the Middle East, changing the way pharmacists interact with patients, reducing poverty in the Third World, and even helping people plan their weddings and accomplish weekend chores.&lt;/p&gt;

I mean, you might &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; you love cooking, but this guy &lt;em&gt;loves&lt;/em&gt; cooking. The most excited text message I received this year was from him, proudly &lt;a href="https://combustion.inc/"&gt;sharing the goddamn analytics on the heat distribution of chicken in his oven with his newly imported thermometer&lt;/a&gt;. We're talking about a culinary madman, capable of anything. The first book he gave me was not remotely related to any technical stack we ran, but was instead a &lt;a href="https://modernistcuisine.com/"&gt;2,438 page &lt;em&gt;manifesto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on cooking. My current relationship is built on the back of a meal he advised me to prepare on the third date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day, we would step out of the office to get some coffee, and on at least three separate occasions we ended up talking about the difficulty of running a top-tier kitchen. And, most shockingly, on all of those occasions, he professed an admiration for the complexity required for McDonald's to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, this startled me - McDonald's! I enjoy myself a mediocre burger as much as the next guy fresh out of university, but the man that graphs the cooking of his chicken is impressed by the place that hungover college students go for their nutrition? Well, it turns out that even if you don't hold the quality of the output in particularly high regard, the optimizations and discipline required to ensure that two different acne-ridden teens with wildly varied education levels, separated by oceans, are capable of producing the same burger are &lt;em&gt;non-trivial&lt;/em&gt; to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man in question catches up on this blog every few weeks, and will be horrified to discover that when you tell a young, impressionable engineer anything, they're going to think about it for three years and then write their own manifesto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="a-brief-glimpse-into-the-c-suite-mindset"&gt;A Brief Glimpse Into The C-Suite Mindset&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, trying to figure out what the goddamn hell is going on in the tech industry, I ended up reading &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/17255186"&gt;The Phoenix Project&lt;/a&gt;. This isn't the main point of bringing the book up, but let's take a brief detour to appreciate how bizarre some parts of it are. Here's the blurb:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill is an IT manager at Parts Unlimited. It's Tuesday morning and on his drive into the office, Bill gets a call from the CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company's new IT initiative, code named Phoenix Project, is critical to the future of Parts Unlimited, but the project is massively over budget and very late. The CEO wants Bill to report directly to him and fix the mess in ninety days or else Bill's entire department will be outsourced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the help of a prospective board member and his mysterious philosophy of The Three Ways, Bill starts to see that IT work has more in common with manufacturing plant work than he ever imagined. With the clock ticking, Bill must organize work flow streamline interdepartmental communications, and effectively serve the other business functions at Parts Unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right, there's a whole genre of corporate fanfiction out there. Was it useful to read? Yes. Does it miss some of the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; barriers to organizations improving? Yes, which I should talk about in another article. Was it cringe-inducing at points? &lt;em&gt;Hell yes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’d use that information to drive our production schedule, so we can manage our supply and demand curves. We’d keep the right products on the right store shelves and keep them stocked. Our revenue per customer would go through the roof. Our average order sizes would go up. We’d finally increase our market share and start beating the competition again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she’s telling us this, she looks animated and excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh &lt;em&gt;baby&lt;/em&gt;, average order size would go up?  I couldn't &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; more animated and excited. It should not surprise anyone that it &lt;a href="https://itrevolution.com/author/gene-kim/"&gt;required a CTO&lt;/a&gt; to unironically write the prose above. It's almost surprising that the next page doesn't talk about how the newfound synergies between the infrastructure team and the developers have made the protagonist positively &lt;em&gt;turgid&lt;/em&gt;. But I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general thrust of the book describes how I.T operations work a lot like a factory floor, and that this has implications for how the flow of work through the organization should be thought about and managed. In fact, the entire book consists of a strange man appearing periodically and giving the protagonist cryptic hints on how to be DevOps-pilled, like if Gandalf knew the only way to defeat Sauron was to help Bilbo fulfill all of his organizational commitments in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some interesting ideas there, but then I realized that there are a &lt;em&gt;few&lt;/em&gt; books that express this kind of sentiment. Quite a few. For one thing, the author has &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; very popular book out called &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/44333183"&gt;The Unicorn Project&lt;/a&gt;. Then there's &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/60872200"&gt;Investments Unlimited&lt;/a&gt;. And they're all inspired by another book called &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/113934.The_Goal"&gt;The Goal&lt;/a&gt;, which is almost the same plot but instead involves a character changing the operations on an actual factory floor, with slightly less cringe-worthy dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written in a fast-paced thriller style, The Goal is the gripping novel which is transforming management thinking throughout the Western world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ooh, a fast-paced story about improving factory throughput? Fuck yes, I'm getting shivers just thinking about it. These all sound like novels that aliens wrote because they've only been able to decrypt the traffic from LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I read &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/324750"&gt;High Output Management&lt;/a&gt; which really &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; good without having as many caveats around the tepid style. It's straightforward and gives good advice for the effective operation of the soulless corporate machine, and it does not aspire to be anything else. And &lt;em&gt;even that&lt;/em&gt; starts with an example of how works flows through a restaurant, complete with a description of how putting eggs on to boil at the wrong time is going to result in cold toast by the time it reaches the customer. A &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; large component to all this thinking is about economies of scale and the flow of work - these themes come up over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="mcdata"&gt;McData&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many months later, and I was walking around the floor &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/an-empty-hall-of-smiling-assassins/"&gt;of a vendor conference&lt;/a&gt; and something began to strike me in the offerings. On this particular day, I happened to be wearing a white shirt with a nice coat, and I suspect many of the salespeople mistook me for management, because they started to pitch me &lt;em&gt;aggressively&lt;/em&gt; on their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a rough rule, I knew the products were not particularly good. I've been burned too many times by seeing organizations purchase shitty enterprise software which promises to fix all of the organization's woes. Just buy Salesforce, or Workday, or Informatica, or whatever! Your staff said $CURRENT_SYSTEM is bad, so buy $NEW_SYSTEM. I'd heard it all before, usually in the context of deprecating $NEW_SYSTEM for $NEW_NEW_SYSTEM because $NEW_SYSTEM fucking suuuuucks. I currently believe that there's only one way to buy yourself out of technical issues and bad data models, and that's buying a really talented engineer whose sole focus is fixing the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what interested me is that they did not spend any time selling me on the technical details of the product. The pitches were &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; focused on something I wouldn't have noticed prior to reading all those books - they were focused on the reproducible delivery of work that was &lt;em&gt;good enough&lt;/em&gt; to accomplish business objectives, without having to rely on all those pesky technicians to be good enough to do the job correctly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, one pitch in particular was for a product which promised to remove the need for me to write SQL in exchange for being able to set up all my dependencies from a drag-and-drop editor, with the sales pitch consisting of "You can get rid of thousands of lines of all that SQL you hate!" - no I can't, fucko, because your application is still connecting to Postgres so it's just writing the SQL for me with another layer of licensed abstraction on top of it. Why would I &lt;em&gt;pay&lt;/em&gt; to have more abstractions designed for &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; to sell software to multiple clients, you blue-suited dementor? Eight times out of ten, I want to pay you to &lt;em&gt;remove&lt;/em&gt; them from my codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;em&gt;you and I&lt;/em&gt; understand that. But I suspect that what an &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; savvy executive hears is a little bit closer to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know that slow, painful SQL that you keep hearing is causing problems? We've got a drag-and-drop interface, so that you can now hire replaceable cogs to do the dragging-and-dropping at a consistent rate. And there's a consistent interface, and a bunch of specialists in this tool on the market, so you can easily ensure the smooth, consistent delivery of data through the organization! Consistent!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or in another context:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you buy a BurgerMaster 5000, you can just drop any teenager behind this thing with thirty minutes of training, and they're going to be able to turn out a burger that's good enough to sell! It's going to be the same burger every time, wherever you ship it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They might not be thinking in &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; these terms, because I genuinely have good reason to believe that the median executive has trouble reading anything that isn't printed in a font so large that it feels like the writer is screaming affirmations at them, but I think this is the &lt;em&gt;gist&lt;/em&gt; of the sales pitch. It is the promise that you can do away with the pesky implementation details of hiring correctly, or addressing all the bad decisions your predecessors made, or even telling your stakeholders that you've over-promised. Nah, you just buy the increased throughput widget, and now all the story points will be done on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heck, even the way Agile is typically implemented at your average (read: dysfunctional and ineffective) workplace reflects this mindset. You count up how many units (story points) of parts (deliverables) that your machines (engineers) can produce, and then you let 'em rip, only to return next week and wonder why the machines only ever hit 50% of their target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="its-fucking-raw"&gt;It's Fucking Raw&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here's where it all falls apart. All of that sounds great - economies of scale, reproducibility, robustness, blah, blah, blah. McDonald's almost never fails to produce fries of approximately the correct quality, within five minutes, every single time I've asked for them, and some of the absolute sons of bitches that I've worked for have &lt;em&gt;clearly never shipped something that delivered value in their whole careers&lt;/em&gt;. They just buy a license for bad software, say that they've successfully implemented it since no one can really check, then leave before the ambient hatred radiating off the people forced to work with the system reaches a level that they can't tolerate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me repeat that again more bluntly - &lt;em&gt;we haven't figured out how to commodify a lot of this work&lt;/em&gt;. Despite my adoration and vested financial interested in computing being something companies need to pay me for, it would actually be &lt;em&gt;really nice&lt;/em&gt; if we could do this successfully. I would adore it if the doctors and nurses in my life didn't constantly lament the stream of indignities that their single-neuron administrators heap upon them with each new proprietary system, even if it forced me to find a new career. Some of these things are just important, but we &lt;em&gt;can't do it yet&lt;/em&gt;. There might be the &lt;em&gt;appearance&lt;/em&gt; that many of these things can be neatly commodified, but the majority of these seem to simply be companies that shouldn't exist selling a product that doesn't work to &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; companies that have oblivious decision-makers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And sometimes, an evil decision-maker that has realized you can just man the phone lines from the third world for pennies because it technically means you're legally compliant, and you don't care about customers that are cancelling anyway. Whenever I need to talk to support staff, I try call the &lt;em&gt;sales&lt;/em&gt; line first and see if they'll fast-track me, because I will get a local with the authority to &lt;em&gt;do things&lt;/em&gt; in 30 seconds.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich Hickey has a delightful talk titled &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc"&gt;Hammock Driven Development&lt;/a&gt;, which I highly recommend. On the topic of innovation, Rich Hickey is the creator (or at least, the most prominent creator) of Clojure, so he &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; has more innovation points than the lower half of the world's managers &lt;em&gt;combined&lt;/em&gt;. My man is out here advocating of a workflow that consists of feeding your subconscious mind research for four hours, then meditating on it for another two, then &lt;em&gt;sleeping&lt;/em&gt; and praying that the Gods of Design simply bless you with an answer in the morning - a strange workflow that I experienced when I was writing my Master's thesis, where I solved problems that feel &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; beyond my ability now, or even in old stories I've heard about the legendary &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/imagination-and-the-imagi_b_8178538"&gt;Poincaré&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;em&gt;all programmers&lt;/em&gt; seem to have experienced the strange phenomena where they walk away and the answer comes to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's plenty of work that consists of simply churning out widgets faster, and I'm happy to see that work disappear (so long as we find a way for people to continue living healthily without it), but it must be acknowledged that many of the things we value in society come from an ill-defined, more vital place, and there is an intersection of that spark with the realities of production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can pay people to churn out bad self-help all day, but none of those are going to be worth a damn without allowing the human element to flourish. But you still need a factory which can print the things, and as clinical as a mass bookbinding operations sounds, I really believe that you're only going to get a beautiful binding when that factory is run by people who have the connection to the work necessary to exercise taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you can refine the delivery of a beautiful meal at a restaurant, but the meal itself is born from a person's creativity and aesthetic sense, trying to weigh itself against the realities of financial constraints. You can streamline it, and you can deliver the same meal every day, but I've &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; the meticulous care of a professional chef running a restaurant in my home country, and successful commodification &lt;em&gt;still requires&lt;/em&gt; intense caring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can try all you want to reduce the delivery of features to a Jira board and mumbling about Agile, but you're not going to get anything worthwhile out of people if you can't connect with them. You think an engineer good enough to have opinions on the relative elegance of cryptic symbols in an IDE can work without an element of soul, because it would be &lt;em&gt;convenient&lt;/em&gt; if he was more like a widget-producing machine? Hah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heck, I know someone that designs some of the chips that go into iPhones, and you'd &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; that would be commodified to hell and back, but at the end of the day it's actually my uncle staying up to 3 AM, calling me from the U.S because he'd like to keep in touch despite the workload - and if that guy gets sick, they're probably &lt;em&gt;actually going to have to delay the next release&lt;/em&gt;. There's crazy infrastructure to allow them to test and mass produce those chips, but &lt;em&gt;individual people&lt;/em&gt; make that machine run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are harsh realities to grapple with, and society runs on commodification, but anyone that thinks that you can run on &lt;em&gt;pure&lt;/em&gt; commodification, without any understanding of their specific craft, or the human complexities, needs, and frailties of the people around them, who think that you can just buy more enterprise licenses and that giving someone a salary is enough reason for them to subjugate the entirety of themselves as they turn up to work every day...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, you're wrong, and you can fucking bite me.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/the-failed-commodification-of-technical-work/</guid></item><item><title>Reflections On Reader Correspondence</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/reflections-on-reader-correspondence/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Bad news everyone - today's post is high on reflection and low on inarticulate rage. It's actually two posts. Reflections on lunch with a reader, and my reflections on the many emails I've received over the past few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, I had such a great time getting lunch that I'm going to erode my SecOps a little bit further. While I love being in touch with people from around the world, and will &lt;em&gt;certainly&lt;/em&gt; arrange some time in Europe and America to get coffee with anyone that is interested, I live in Melbourne. Feel free to reach out if you're anywhere in the country and you'd like to catch up to nerd out. I'll fly to Perth for a single beer, just watch me. While I can't promise that I'll get to everyone for coffee, while I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; to reply to every email, I suspect there won't be that many people here in Australia. As always, reach me at ludicity.hackernews@gmail.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I can feel management's noose slowly tightening around my neck. They're going to work out who I am one day, and I hope you all appreciate me self-immolating for your amusement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i-lunch"&gt;I. Lunch&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, a reader reached out to me and managed to guess I was in Australia based entirely off my description of the technical dysfunction. I suspect that Australia is unusually bad for a culturally Western nation for who knows what reason, but it was still a very impressive prediction - based on my correspondence with readers, things are pretty fucked everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, it was a tremendous experience, and I have finally monetized my writing to the tune of one cup of coffee. Feels good to be a sellout. I'll leave the person and the company anonymous, but I wanted to highlight a few things that really stood out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="i-coffee"&gt;I. Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the person I spoke to was an engineering manager, and when I mentioned that I've been looking into Elixir, he spoke very highly of his own experiences with Erlang and the BEAM virtual machine, two topics that I know absolutely nothing about, and suggested that I would benefit greatly from diving into these topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was fucking &lt;em&gt;wild&lt;/em&gt; to me, because I didn't realize they actually made management with that level of competence at the factory. Can we run another batch in production? While he rightfully pointed out that I hadn't seen him code when I expressed amazement... well, look at it from my perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received a message this week from someone that manages engineers and is "on the tools" asking whether it was a good idea to delete files from a Git repository that were no longer in use, because in theory you could check out older commits. The answer is &lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt;, and I'm glad they've realized it's absurd to have 100 files in a folder called &lt;code&gt;archive&lt;/code&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;this is a ridiculous question for someone that has senior engineers reporting into them to ask&lt;/em&gt;. And this is one of the most technical managers I've ever worked with, and because I'm a typical young person with no staying power, I've worked at a reasonable number of places already. I would &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; it if that poor, out-of-their-depth bastard had opinions on the relative quality of Erlang. God, I can't even &lt;em&gt;imagine&lt;/em&gt; that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, we spoke at some length around why things are dysfunctional, and it was gratifying to hear that it turns out most of my ideas on how things could be run... just work in the right environment. Frankly, many of them would work where I am now, and there's no reason we don't do them correctly other than not caring. He also remarked that he had worked at many dysfunctional places until making the jump to "better" places, and noted that the CTO was a big reason for joining the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn't even understand this, because the CTO at &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; organization technically only manages a staff around the size of this reader's entire company (even though the organization is huge) and they... well, I've heard they're smart, but suffice it to say that they don't seem to get any results. I don't think it's their fault - the organization is ineffective and no human can fix it - but I couldn't imagine it even mattering who the CTO is. They certainly don't know everyone's name, and once called my senior colleague "that smart intern". And &lt;em&gt;literally as I was shaking this reader's hand&lt;/em&gt;, I received four messages from colleagues telling me that the CTO had credited someone else with the &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-accidentally-saved-half-a-million-dollars/"&gt;Snowflake savings&lt;/a&gt; at an all-hands meeting, then said "and I think Ludic helped?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And I didn't care because they don't even say hello to me!&lt;/em&gt; Why would I care what they think about my work if they aren't going to fire me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, long story short, it was like meeting a version of myself from the Good Timeline, where you eventually find pleasant people who just do a good job and don't torture each other endlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ii-meeting-the-rest-of-the-team"&gt;II. Meeting The Rest Of The Team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I am actually invited upstairs to meet the rest of the team, including the mythical good CTO. Let us take a moment to reflect on how brave this reader is. Upon meeting a man who wrote something called &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-will-fucking-dropkick-you-if-you-use-that-spreadsheet/"&gt;"I Will Fucking Dropkick You If You Use That Spreadsheet"&lt;/a&gt; for an hour, he thought "seems like a sensible move to introduce him to the C-suite".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently some of my posts had circulated a little bit, and I'm afraid I might have let some people down by not frothing at the mouth in real life. I was horrified to hear the CTO greet me as "the angry blog guy" (this is not effective corporate branding), but you know what, fair assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get to talking, and the CTO was, to use the technical term, &lt;em&gt;based&lt;/em&gt;. All in on the idea that engineering managers must be technical. Lamented the fact that even good hires had to be "de-corporatised" after years of moulding themselves to get along with grifters, morons, and sociopaths. I believe someone said the CTO had contributed to &lt;em&gt;complex&lt;/em&gt; open-source projects. Again, every workplace is going to have some problems, and no one is without flaws... but I returned to my own office on Monday and watched our leadership talk about how many goals they were kicking (to be fair, they didn't say they aren't own-goals) with disappointment. Everyone has flaws, but people deserve leaders who aren't utterly self-deluded or ineffectively bragging constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all went out to lunch together, and at my prompting one of the engineers tried to explain what Org Mode is on Emacs (I remain convinced this is a cult), we spoke about how we would know if an artificial intelligence was sentient, and just generally had a good time. I don't think I've seen a team casually get lunch and drinks without drowning in cynicism since I was a totally fresh graduate, and it was refreshing. You'd have to &lt;em&gt;pay me&lt;/em&gt; a few hundred dollars to get lunch with some of the managers in my department, and here I was with a whole team of people who agree with the tone of the writing here, can stand each other's company, and even the CTO comes down with them to eat. Utterly alien, and possibly paid actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been invited in for Friday drinks, and to meet two other teams, which I'll certainly do. Again, they were the first to tell me that they've got their own problems - but there's hope out there if you're somewhere terrible, that's all I'm saying. Also the lunch place would have made &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; pretty well-paid colleagues complain about the prices, so they're probably not doing too badly in the remuneration department either - that isn't even the main factor in enjoying work, but it certainly doesn't hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-thoughts-on-emails"&gt;II. Thoughts On Emails&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll try keep this brief, as I received far too many emails to write about them at length. Here are my broad takeaways after processing many stories and wise words from dozens of engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are certainly two tiers of company in terms of pleasantness. The majority of people seem to go through their entire careers working at terrible place after terrible place due to path dependence in their network and the fact that &lt;em&gt;most places suck&lt;/em&gt;. My workplace sounds terrible, but I assure you that it is better than most. Find a good place instead if you intend to stay employed. The pay is better &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; they're nicer for the most part.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The good places are, as I've mentioned elsewhere, small, and run by compassionate people that don't want to grow forever. There aren't many of them. The level of dysfunction at large places varies wildly, but they're always going to be there, so if you have a low tolerance like myself, they're almost ruled out immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being this honest means that some employers won't work with me. This is fine when times are good, as it's removing people I wouldn't enjoy working with anyway, but could be rough when times are desperate. But I haven't been outright killed, so you can be braver than you think if you're willing to take the risk to reap the rewards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The market is so absolutely desperate for good engineers that the main difficulty is having a network strong enough to get warm introductions to people, and they'll always have work for you. And I write &lt;em&gt;Python&lt;/em&gt; at the level taught to generic data scientists and am considered &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; by the market, so you're almost certainly fine too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Markets and companies are not efficient, and by extension, neither are the good engineers stuck working for jerks. I had a very long exchange with a reader, and interviewed some talented engineers at a company that wasn't treating them that well &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; that badly. They all agreed that the main reason they stayed was being underconfident that they could do better, even though to an outside observer they obviously could.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with people you like is very important. It dominates all other considerations in terms of day-to-day happiness. People that you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; like can become difficult to be around if the broader environment is toxic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/"&gt;Ask for more money&lt;/a&gt;. I don't even care about the money, but you get respect for negotiating like a professional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the room. When your organization indicates that they don't care about quality, &lt;em&gt;believe them&lt;/em&gt; and don't waste your time. There are a lot of teams that don't even version control their code, and they will all say that they want to improve their practices. &lt;em&gt;If they were serious, they would already be version controlling their code&lt;/em&gt;. Things that are sufficiently bad are going to stay bad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is very important, so I will repeat it. If the organization is &lt;em&gt;doing nothing right&lt;/em&gt;, then they probably &lt;em&gt;are incapable of doing so&lt;/em&gt; regardless of what they say.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will probably not be rewarded for going above-and-beyond. Sad fact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If management picks on you, just leave ASAP. It will end badly. I would like to set up some (free for users) platform for blog readers here to network on to this end - hit me up if you have ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can sell your soul for a while, but you've got to pay that debt eventually, and it can be very painful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organizations eventually pay the price for these severe inefficiencies, but all the current actors that benefited from them will just leave. But if you're in an inefficient system, don't assume your job is safe. A lot of the stories I heard ended with products and companies eventually shutting down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be likeable, reliable, meet lots of people, &lt;em&gt;and ask for more money&lt;/em&gt;. Then your career will sort itself out. Being likeable is easier said than done, but it is definitely a learnable skill for most people. You just &lt;em&gt;don't talk like a corporate dweeb&lt;/em&gt; and people think you're a no-nonsense person who gets stuff done. The industry is handing you this win on a silver platter. When I wrote my first post, I &lt;em&gt;predicted&lt;/em&gt; beforehand that it would hit the Hackernews frontpage because it didn't have a gross sanitized tone. I half-believed it couldn't be that easy, but there you go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't work for dickheads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't work for dickheads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let me check my Bloomberg terminal - it says "Don't work for dickheads, they aren't paying you enough".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These may sounds obvious, but most success at this early stage in my life has stemmed from &lt;em&gt;noticing obvious mistakes&lt;/em&gt;, then making obvious corrections. If they weren't obvious, I would have to be &lt;em&gt;smart&lt;/em&gt; to exploit them which I am not.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/reflections-on-reader-correspondence/</guid></item><item><title>Registering My Hypotheses On Starting A Business</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/registering-my-hypotheses-on-starting-a-business/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I've mentioned that I'm starting a company with friends - no, this isn't a plug for us. The name of the company won't even be mentioned. We now have five engineers on board, one being a 15-year industry veteran, though we're all working on it part-time. Without getting into the details, I've had a very easy time succeeding in the tech industry despite moving to a country with no network and decent programming skills at &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; - I've done a few things that are supposed to be hard, like getting a job without a permanent work visa, within about an hour of trying, after carefully building a model of how the job market works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are bad at looking for work, but they keep trying the same steps over and over. I see that, despair for them, but that doesn't stop me from benefiting. Similarly, when I see people tank their software projects day in and day out... well, that seems like opportunity to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm now taking my hubris to the next logical step, and will try to seize the means of production for myself and my friends. As I've mentioned elsewhere, I have an absolute commitment to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; monetizing my blog. It is literally impossible to host ads on Mataroa, the only analytics I have are "numbers of viewers rounded to the nearest thousand per day", and even &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is flushed every thirty days. I'm writing here because if I can reliably find an algorithm for generating, say, 150K in profit per person in a small team, that would be a wonderful thing to document. And I fail, well, that's useful too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i-why"&gt;I. Why?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might help to get into why first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few layers to this. At the very baseline level, I'd like to work with a team that operates more competently, because &lt;em&gt;incompetent operations&lt;/em&gt; make the work unpleasant. I had the fortune of talking to &lt;a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/"&gt;David Gerard&lt;/a&gt; this year, who was absolutely delightful and gave me some hard-earned life experience - a lot of work is work, but "the minutes can't be miserable". Incompetent work is miserable for some people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I've been asked why I don't go work at Netflix or Amazon - despite my skills not being that refined, I don't shy away from hard work when there's a reward for it. The reason I don't do it is that I don't care about the work there at this stage in my life. There is a (long) &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-vJcOfrvi0"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; from Primeagen where he talks about how he spent a year of his life getting episodes of Black Mirror to appear in a different order at the behest of Netflix management, a feature that many people seem to have interpreted as a bug. A &lt;em&gt;year of his life&lt;/em&gt;. Brother, that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a fucking episode of Black Mirror. I don't have it in me. Work, competent as it might be, isn't enough for me if it is &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; unaligned with my values. Don't confuse this with it being bad work - if my man is happy, he's happy. It's just not for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, something that always bothers me with software is this idea that you have to keep building. It's crazy to me. It's extremely unique as a field in that &lt;em&gt;the computer does all the work&lt;/em&gt;. It seems to me that the goal with most systems should be to refine them into a razor edge (which, admittedly, is a task that never quite finishes) and then just stop. Let the machine print the money. If you wisely decide that you don't need infinite money, then you can just... stop. I'd like to build things correctly with my friends, and leave it at that. Some people must need a good job done, and then they're happy as long as that thing just keeps working flawlessly with good customer service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I requested a feature change for Mataroa once, this blogging platform, and it was done within about 15 minutes. That's what you can accomplish by doing your operations correctly - &lt;em&gt;this blog platform&lt;/em&gt; does more traffic than any all but two systems we have at work, and it seems to mostly be kept running &lt;a href="https://github.com/mataroa-blog/mataroa/graphs/contributors"&gt;by three chads scattered across the UK and Germany&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people have suggested &lt;em&gt;finding&lt;/em&gt; a company that already operates this way, but the simple truth is that they're probably few and far between. The &lt;em&gt;uglier&lt;/em&gt; truth from my experience is that most tech companies seem to be started by some extremely distasteful personality types (not all, most). And once you've gotten it working, the temptation to make yourself richer overwhelms those personalities. Plus the nicer people don't want to scale forever, so they're a rare breed of person that &lt;em&gt;doesn't have a reason to hire tons of people&lt;/em&gt;. And for the others - I spoke to a lot of executives (none self-made, all &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1151666832702615553?lang=en"&gt;"ladder climbers"&lt;/a&gt;) about starting a business, and almost every single one started advising me on how to get VC money immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuck VC money, that's just a job with extra steps. I have a soul that I'd like to keep, thank you very much, we're going to bootstrap. In other words, cowabunga it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the same vein, I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; wait for someone else to set up a business that runs in a way I find spiritually acceptable, but that doesn't sound like the right way to take control of your life. "Wait for someone else to do it then see if they'll take you." I've never accomplished &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; I'm happy with that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-exploiting-inefficiency"&gt;II. Exploiting Inefficiency&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to pick up wins is to find things that people are doing nonsensically &lt;em&gt;for no reason&lt;/em&gt; and then eat their lunch. I spent a lot of time worrying about this early on - surely people wouldn't do things stupidly for literally no reason with millions of dollars on the line. Markets are at least sort of efficient!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I saw how government contractors work. &lt;em&gt;Some&lt;/em&gt; markets are efficient and software doesn't seem to be one of them. The thing is that no one seems to have figured out how to commoditize good engineering and being a good person. I mean, even in my case, those engineers working with me? That's years of patient friendship and honest communication culminating in an opportunity. I taught one of them how to program when he needed to both move states while supporting his newborn kid, and I removed the other from a very toxic workplace to a life of Zen prosperity. And we're &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; going in as equal partners, because we're friends. I couldn't scale that no matter how hard I tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the competition has beautiful PowerPoints, but they can't forge a human connection worth a damn. In the world where everyone is corporate, the person that acts like a human is king/queen. My plan is very, very simple. What if we just... don't write shitty software, treat our customers fairly, and run a tight ship? There aren't enough people doing this to saturate the market. The reason that doesn't sound innovative is precisely because it isn't an innovation - it just doesn't scale, so I think it's a formula that isn't talked about very much. I suspect it has a &lt;em&gt;high&lt;/em&gt; success rate. I received this in an email from someone that runs a business, and can't stop thinking about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to a solid career seems to be at the intersection of being likable and reliable. The key to being incredibly successful is to win the lottery with a novel idea AND execute it in a way that is likable and reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, we don't need to be &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; successful, and the first two steps are very easy. It isn't that hard to be nice to people, and the nice thing about reliability is you get there by turning up every day and being honest. &lt;em&gt;Very easy&lt;/em&gt; if you aren't incentivized badly. There will be plenty of clients that want to be lied to, and they can always pick Deloitte if they need that. There will be others who want some nice people who really care about making them happy, and it may be the case that the market is too small for that... but I don't think so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm working with the people I've recruited on developing the slickest operations you can imagine for developing and maintaining applications (we could probably skip this step if we had some Amazon experience), then we're going to bid on a few contracts that come with recurring licensing fees, and regardless of how nice the Deloitte presentations are, there's &lt;a href="https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/enterprise_sales"&gt;already a playbook&lt;/a&gt; out on how to bully those grifters into submission. Plus one of the guys on the team has already had a very successful career as a solo consultant and believes the plan is workable, and three of us in total have adequate sales skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I've actually &lt;em&gt;worked&lt;/em&gt; sales before. Forgive me.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be competing with many enterprise vendors for most contracts, but most of those vendors have a single product that can be "configured" to match any company's workflow. This means that they mostly suck. Because we aren't planning to scale, we can pick on these groups by just building some specifically for each client, and with similar stacks, we can run maintenance in very similar styles. Most of these applications will never see more than a few hundred queries an hour. Five actually good engineers feels like an overwhelming amount of firepower to have at our disposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it probably won't turn out this easy, but let me register some predictions for the year, and then I'll keep everyone posted on how we're going every so often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-predictions"&gt;III. Predictions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reiterate, I'm saying that it seems to me that there aren't nearly enough teams for hire that can just get the job done without making a huge mess out of it, and as long as we compete on the grounds of building &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what a company needs in a way that is maintainable (i.e, we'll actually test our backups unlike the average sad competitor), we can work for ourselves. My predictions for 2024 are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will generate enough revenue in 2024 that at least one of us will be able to leave their day jobs entirely. The revenue may not be a recurring licensing fee as would be ideal, but it should be from a client who is happy that their software is getting delivered on time for a change, and that everyone is happy with it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We won't need to work anywhere close to 9-5, because we don't have constant communications overhead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will have a contract by March 2024, paying at least AUD 30,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I won't have to miss a single session of any of my hobbies over company-related issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some lesson important predictions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After our current experimentation, I suspect we will be building in one of Elixir, Clojure, Kotlin, or &lt;em&gt;possibly&lt;/em&gt; Rust. I can't imagine Python winning out even though it is my area of expertise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-constraints"&gt;IV. Constraints&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My strange personality means that many of the things I do have very little to do with the money or status, and a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; to do with ensuring that I'm not crazy, and there really &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; just a whole bunch of super easy, obvious advantages that people aren't picking up on for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That reason (it isn't a good experiment if it isn't replicable by people without blog readerships!), and because I've sworn that I will never monetize this blog in any way is why I haven't immediately posted the company name to get traction. The only thing I am actively soliciting is advisors, with the understanding that any lessons learned will be made available for the benefit of anyone that wants to take the same path. If you've got a specialty and would like to make yourself available for casual conversation on issues (for example, we've got a security specialist off this blog) to form a corpus of advice, as always, you can reach me at ludicity.hackernews@gmail.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be out enjoying nature this weekend, but I'll be back to writing and replying to emails soon! Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/registering-my-hypotheses-on-starting-a-business/</guid></item><item><title>PowerBI Is A Human Rights Violation</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/powerbi-is-a-human-rights-violation/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In 1985, I murdered a man in cold blood over something petty. I can't remember what it was - all I remember was the fleeting sense of relief that the struggle was over, then years of panic, trying to hide what I'd done from the authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully Microsoft released PowerBI in 2015, so I put all the evidence in a dashboard and now I sleep soundly, secure in the knowledge that no one is ever, ever going to look at it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you PowerBI!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i-what-is-powerbi"&gt;I. What is PowerBI?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't ask questions that you don't want answered. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/YCMtaTi6kMQ?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=954"&gt;Here's an excerpt&lt;/a&gt; from Primagen (a Netflix gigabrain) and TJ DeVries (one of Neovim's core maintainers) learning what it is from their Twitch chat while reading one of my other posts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primagen: "PowerBI - as I'm being told - is a data visualization tool like Tableau. &lt;em&gt;Oh&lt;/em&gt;, it's a data visualization tool like Tableau. It's Tableau but by Microsoft. Oh shoot, that sounds awful."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TJ: &amp;lt;laughing&amp;gt; "Well that sounds productive!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to provide any more details because you're better off not knowing, okay? This is for your own good. Given conditions in the country I immigrated from, I am a big fan of free speech, but I would abandon all my principles in a &lt;em&gt;heartbeat&lt;/em&gt; if it meant scrubbing PowerBI from the collective consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-the-hole-we-shovel-productivity-into"&gt;II. The Hole We Shovel Productivity Into&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first job interview in the tech space was for a data science role, and involved questions about XGBoost and ETL practices, eventually culminating in a very generous offer. In fact, it was &lt;em&gt;exorbitant&lt;/em&gt; because I didn't actually have a solid working visa (just a terrible student one) &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; my answers to the questions weren't very good. Apparently I cleaned up... and &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; should have been my first clue as to the world I was about to enter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, the two questions were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Can you use XGBoost?"&lt;br&gt;
"I've used it before a little bit without any hyperparameter tuning and it did really well, but I'm not scared of the documentation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Do you know what ETL is?"&lt;br&gt;
"Yes. (lie)"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, my manager is nonetheless actually quite brilliant, and we begin the difficult task of rolling out machine learning and advanced analytics in our department. We start by producing some spreadsheets for stakeholders that were &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be produced by the team that our newly formed squad was replacing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh, and then another spreadsheet. And another. And the spreadsheet pipeline has fallen over - we'll do some advanced work soon! And then finally, one day, I am asked to produce a PowerBI report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh &lt;em&gt;boy&lt;/em&gt;, what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; this thing? Almost every job mentioned they wanted PowerBI experience, and I was sure lucky that they waived that for me. Hint: they waive it for everyone because it takes like five minutes to learn how to use this piece of garbage to the level required. You will understand why shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You connect it to spreadsheets, then you drag charts onto a page, and it makes graphs that I can't even describe as pretty. If you want to get &lt;em&gt;extra&lt;/em&gt; fancy, you may connect it to a database, but this is approaching a level of sophistication that 90% of companies aren't prepared for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say my team produced a new dashboard around once a week, so we probably had made about 50 of the things before the year was out. Basically &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; our work resulted in a dashboard being produced. Stakeholder needs number, we put number in dashboard, we link stakeholder, &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt;. I hated it because I'm a programmer and this was stupid, tedious, manual, and soul-crushing, but I figured "that's working life, I guess!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But something still felt a little bit off. These numbers just... didn't seem useful. Sometimes I made glaring mistakes and only noticed two months later when I re-examined my work for some reason. Then I realized you can examine usage metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No one reads them&lt;/em&gt;. It's just some stupid long-tailed distribution where &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; of these absolutely useless fucking things gets read a few times a day (by someone that probably doesn't do anything with the information) and the rest of them &lt;em&gt;don't get read at all&lt;/em&gt;. And guess what, I brought fucking &lt;em&gt;receipts&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-receipts"&gt;III. Receipts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've mentioned elsewhere that I played extreme hardball with my organization this time around - they lost a ton of good engineers in one week, so they desperately made me a higher offer than almost anyone else at my department makes. Better roll up my sleeves - I heard you folks need someone that can write a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of decent Python without committing any programming war crimes, and I'm the only senior around to do it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First task? PowerBI dashboard so that we can monitor access to restricted data. Does this need to be done? Only if we check every day, because in an emergency I can just write the SQL to investigate this on the spot. Ah, fuck, here we go again. I did it, and it has been about a year, so let's take a look at those usage statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="my_dashboard.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/31fffc4a.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hell yes, &lt;em&gt;zero views&lt;/em&gt; in the past three months? I'm so glad that's where we decided to allocate &lt;em&gt;the only senior engineer&lt;/em&gt; after paying his exorbitant ransom. We are fully Agile, baby. I could not be happier to have spent my precious hours on this beautiful planet creating this dashboard. Why don't we &lt;em&gt;just have Universal Basic Income&lt;/em&gt;? I'm already basically on welfare, but instead of distributing it evenly to people that need it, we're &lt;em&gt;giving it all to me because I say I'm an engineer&lt;/em&gt;, and to top it all of you make me pretend to work. Just cut out the middle man and give us the money!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And holy shit, does that say we have &lt;em&gt;ten thousand&lt;/em&gt; of these things in the organization? Ten &lt;em&gt;thousand&lt;/em&gt;? What? Fucking &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt;? Also...that's weird... when I was glancing around for more dashboards to get data on, I keep getting this notification at the top of my browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="refresh_notice.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/abe27062.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to inactivity, scheduled refresh has been disabled. We're starting it again now. Please check back later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wait&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Every&lt;/em&gt; report has a built-in kill switch on the automatic refreshing if it isn't being used? And &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; report I've clicked on has hit that limit? I start just flicking through random workspaces. Behold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="nothing_refreshed.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/ef8a230b.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't find anything that has refreshed this &lt;em&gt;month&lt;/em&gt; without some deep digging. Eventually I come across something that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; used and somehow it is even worse. Feast your eyes upon this putrid buffet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="used_dashboard.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/9597e26b.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;. Let's break this down. This organization has 1.8K dashboards. I have no idea why &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; dashboard's usage metrics said 10K, but suffice it to say this is probably evidence that we must have &lt;em&gt;multiple&lt;/em&gt; sub-organizations and thus may have way more than 10K dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past three months, this dashboard has a total of 38 views, so give-or-take, one view every three days... and it's ranked number &lt;strong&gt;SIX&lt;/strong&gt;? If the sixth most-viewed dashboard is getting a view every three days &lt;em&gt;and we know most of them aren't being refreshed&lt;/em&gt; then we have almost &lt;em&gt;certainly&lt;/em&gt; spent thousands of hours of people's lives, that they could have been spending with their kids or some wholesome bullshit, making &lt;em&gt;thousands of reports that no one reads&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reader linked me to &lt;a href="https://tenforward.social/@elight/111337039126259704"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; comment on some earlier writing, and I want to highlight one part of it that stood out to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the bane of large interests is that, just by dint of communication complexity alone (leaving aside politics/fiefdoms, "compliance" process and associated mandatory trainings, etc), they are extremely wasteful machines that largely squander human creativity and wisdom all while generating massive revenue due to small but effective groups within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know that organizations waste human creativity, but something struck me about wasting human &lt;em&gt;wisdom&lt;/em&gt; as being a little bit more grotesque. David Whyte has a &lt;a href="https://davidwhyte.com/pages/consolations"&gt;lovely little book&lt;/a&gt; that explores the underlying connotations of various words through a poet's lens. I frankly cannot aspire to write as beautifully as him, and my words fail me here, but there is something profoundly &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; about wasting human wisdom this way. The thought of all those staff, dragged in day-after-day, churning out these widgets that no one uses... there is something immeasurably perverse about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-technical-details-or-whatever"&gt;IV. Technical Details or Whatever&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a lot more to say about the technical issues with PowerBI. You can't programmatically edit the files, so migrating one thousand reports to a new database means opening one thousand files by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason you can't edit them is that they're all some fucked series of compressed XML files that you can unzip but can't re-zip without some in-house tool from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data is loaded directly into the dashboard file (hence the encryption thing above) so these things can get &lt;em&gt;massive&lt;/em&gt;, and due to the compression and inclusion of data, they're all BLOBs that don't version control nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search results for any complex task are littered with people asking and getting silence despite this trash product's absolute ubiquity across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examining the data lineage on these dashboards, almost all of them are powered by variants of 'important_spreadsheet_final_final_v2.xlsx".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't get an organization-level view of dashboard usage without access to the admin API, which is not so much a bug as what must be a deliberate choice to help companies continue to pretend that the analytics department is doing a good job because there are a lot of dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I got to this point and then thought "What is the point of criticizing a product that no one uses?", because we don't &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; use it. We have a hundred blacksmiths turning out tools that we then immediately throw into a shed forever. The details of the hammer we give them, as &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; as that hammer might be, really doesn't matter when the elephant in the room is that we've got this much busywork for people. I know some people wonder whether &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs"&gt;David Graeber's so-called "Bullshit Jobs"&lt;/a&gt; actually exist. Well, there you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a friend that is currently the director at a place that is at &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; somewhat competent - the kind of director that reads books on psychology, strategy, and programs Rust. When the topic came up a few weeks ago, he said something to the effect of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You don't want to work at a place that takes PowerBI seriously. I &lt;em&gt;guess&lt;/em&gt; the tool is fine if stakeholders are self-serving for something important, but anywhere that has teams dedicated to using it is very likely to have a lot of muppets. Any stakeholder that says they don't have time to operate the drag-and-drop tool is either for asking something that isn't important enough to spend time on, or is too dumb to use it themselves, and you don't want to work for either of them."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v-in-conclusion"&gt;V. In Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PowerBI makes me want to PowerDIE, is a profound offense to whatever nobility is inherent to the human spirit, and anyone asking for one of these fucking things to be produced should be treated - pending the &lt;em&gt;greatest&lt;/em&gt; justification the world has ever seen - like they have stopped the meeting to take a piss on everyone's shoes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/powerbi-is-a-human-rights-violation/</guid></item><item><title>Strategy Doesn't Matter If You Blunder Every Move</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/strategy-doesnt-matter-if-you-blunder-every-move/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Before I get into it, I'm &lt;a href="https://mastodon.sprawl.club/@ludicity"&gt;on Mastodon now&lt;/a&gt;. Now I have a platform for all my intrusive thoughts during standup. Anyway...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an incredibly patient and kind lead engineer on my team - the kind of person that gives me hope that maybe, while the corporate world is run on horrific incentives, it &lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; efficient enough to crush all that is good and holy from this world. They have been at this organization for many, many years, and will probably remain at it for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time we sit down for our 1:1s, I'm pretty honest about my assessment on the state of things, and we always agree that things are bad but have completely diverging views on things. A recurring theme is that we &lt;em&gt;agree that something has been done badly&lt;/em&gt;, but then have wildly diverging ideas on the relative worthiness of our department's performance - namely, that the &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many people, I got into chess over the Covid lockdowns, where I was introduced to two broad ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is chess &lt;em&gt;strategy&lt;/em&gt;, where you make a plan like "control the center of the board", and then there are chess &lt;em&gt;tactics&lt;/em&gt;, which are ideally how you execute in a fashion where you don't lose all your best pieces every thirty seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to fire flaming laser beams out of my eyes at the next person to insist that "we had a good strategy" while we continually demonstrate that we can't make it five moves without losing our queen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i-playing-0-dimensional-chess"&gt;I. Playing 0-Dimensional Chess&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, everyone, I have an idea! Let's build the world's greatest, most commercially viable quantum computer and make billions. Oh, we can't do that? Well, the &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; was sound. I'll still take that executive salary, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you've got the kind of people around that have &lt;em&gt;demonstrated they can do this&lt;/em&gt;, then that is a &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; idea. Most organizations in our industry operate at a level so utterly pathetic that any plan that doesn't start with "we won't do anything until everyone on staff can write &lt;a href="https://dhwthompson.com/2019/my-favourite-git-commit"&gt;a coherent commit message&lt;/a&gt;" is fucking lunacy. And listen, this is &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt; - this is the reality of the world, and I will happily sit down and teach anyone that is willing to learn... unless you're on a manager's salary and already bossing people around, in which case get the fuck outta here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started fencing back at university, our coach just made us drill footwork for a million years before we actually had any bouts, because it turns out &lt;em&gt;you can't fence&lt;/em&gt; if you don't have your basics in place. You can't fence without footwork, you can't &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; play chess until you know how the pieces move, and you &lt;em&gt;absolutely can't&lt;/em&gt; run any sort of engineering unless you've got all your basics in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well, you don't have to be able to code to man-"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop. Stop. Yes, you do. If your organization is sufficiently dysfunctional, there is indeed a role a manager can fulfill that allows them to succeed at managing engineers that doesn't require engineering knowledge. This role is to float about fifty feet above the ground, arms outstretched, screaming, as all the latent psychic harm flowing in from various stakeholders shreds their mind into tiny ribbons in an eye-watering display of self-sacrifice. Don't get me wrong, I &lt;em&gt;appreciate&lt;/em&gt; the people that do this, but unless we're talking about that, &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; you need to know what good engineering looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maybe&lt;/em&gt; I would be able to manage a team of doctors &lt;em&gt;if they were already incredibly effective&lt;/em&gt; and had all their processes down. It might be hard, but I would just have to keep people off their backs - i.e, float above the ground, scream, etc. There's &lt;em&gt;no way&lt;/em&gt; I could manage a team of junior doctors that didn't know how to sterilize medical equipment, and that's the state of most of our industry. The patient is bleeding out, half the doctors can't stand the sight of blood, and the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; half are being told they can't operate until they make sure there are enough cards on the backlog. We need to either &lt;em&gt;let good people operate&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;show people how to operate&lt;/em&gt; and anything else is just going to get the patient killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember reading some time ago that the average engineer team probably can't ship a CRUD application. A solved problem. In theory, you just import Django, and even if you completely screwed up the requirements, you can just... change the thing. And we probably can't do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-playing-5-dimensional-chess"&gt;II. Playing 5-Dimensional Chess&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; thing that happens is that we do something absolutely inexplicably dumb, and then people will begin to posit that there's secretly some reason it was done that way. God, I wish that was the case. It would be less embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, when I talked about saving half a million dollars by clicking a few buttons, someone on the internet, in all their wisdom, pointed out that maybe someone was &lt;em&gt;banking the inefficiency&lt;/em&gt; so they could drop their budget during a cost-cutting period. I mean, sure, I guess, but it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; actually just incompetence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same vein, we recently put up a position description that was absolutely absurd. We're attempting to hire someone with four years of experience in, let me check my notes, SageMaker, dbt, Snowflake, FiveTran, and "&lt;em&gt;advanced statistical analysis&lt;/em&gt;" for uh... as much money as this &lt;em&gt;same organization&lt;/em&gt; paid me when I was a fresh grad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What?&lt;/em&gt; Apparently we haven't been able to fill the role. &lt;em&gt;Wow!&lt;/em&gt; I wonder what went wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sit down with the lead engineer and we talk about this - and he hits me with a very sensible story about how &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; management knows what they're doing. You see, by having the position description be that absurd, you can &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; transfer people from any part of the organization into the role. You can swap in a data scientist, a data engineer, a software developer, &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; a general enterprise software nerd, and HR isn't going to make a big deal out of it. Yes, that must be it, management is playing 6-Dimensional Hungry Hungry Hippos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, I had lunch with a director at the level above the lead, I put the same scenario to him, complete with this very sophisticated explanation for why the position description is laughable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Oh, no, it was just incompetence. Transferring people internally isn't that hard."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think some people just assume that no one can be &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; incompetent. Like, yes, we're incompetent at getting the job filled, but there's a meta-level task, get people transferred, and we're &lt;em&gt;killing it&lt;/em&gt; at that. What if we're just not? What if we're just a bunch of apes that have only recently descended from the trees, desperately trying to play electron Lego and failing miserably? Many things would look the same and it is a &lt;em&gt;hell&lt;/em&gt; of a lot simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-actually-trying"&gt;III. Actually Trying&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to be serious for a second. Forgive me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was speaking to a friend recently who has been suffering from this. They work at a hospital. Every day, management talks about strategy, and Agile, and whatever the fuck, while they just bungle all the reporting they need to allocate beds to patients correctly. The friend has been feeling bad about reading documentation during work hours, because they really feel that their team is just blundering their tactics at every turn, and needs things like, oh, I don't know, &lt;em&gt;version control and code reviews&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friend: I've rationalised my time theft to myself with the idea that maybe one day I'll implement a GitOps pipeline for the hospital. Not likely though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Despite how the hospital treats it, you're in a very serious craft now. We have our own, strange culture that is inscrutable to outsiders, and we're the kind of people that might spend years meditating on the correct pattern that imaginary constructions should use to connect to someone else's imaginary construction. Hardcore engineering is like a strange priesthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Your professional obligation, which overrides the simpler considerations of short-sighted managers, is to ensure that the machinery of our craft is operating in the correct fashion. This fashion has nothing to do with what management wants, no matter what they say, unless they can convince you. We may have to make concessions to management sometimes because we rely on them for money, but that's the same thing as cutting corners in patient care - maybe no one suffers immediately so it's not as serious, but the crime is still there, with a lesser magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: I genuinely think you have a quasi-religious obligation to push for the GitOps pipeline, even if you know it will probably never happen, if you know that's what is right for the patients. Stopping that and working on whatever dipshit report they need to get promoted is the actual unethical concession that we're forced to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a little bit embarrassing to re-read that as it romanticizes engineering quite a bit - I suspect in a way that I can only do because I'm not that &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; at it. But I do believe it. It's frustrating (and funny) when I think about how many places can't get the most basic parts of their act together, but I find that my sense of humor altogether deserts me when I think about healthcare operations. I've quoted this elsewhere, but:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you understand what I'm saying?" shouted Moist. "You can't just go around killing people!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Why Not? You Do." The golem lowered his arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What?" snapped Moist. "I do not! Who told you that?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I Worked It Out. You Have Killed Two Point Three Three Eight People," said the golem calmly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I have never laid a finger on anyone in my life, Mr Pump. I may be–– all the things you know I am, but I am not a killer! I have never so much as drawn a sword!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No, You Have Not. But You Have Stolen, Embezzled, Defrauded And Swindled Without Discrimination, Mr Lipwig. You Have Ruined Businesses And Destroyed Jobs. When Banks Fail, It Is Seldom Bankers Who Starve. Your Actions Have Taken Money From Those Who Had Little Enough To Begin With. In A Myriad Small Ways You Have Hastened The Deaths Of Many. You Do Not Know Them. You Did Not See Them Bleed. But You Snatched Bread From Their Mouths And Tore Clothes From Their Backs. For Sport, Mr Lipwig. For Sport. For The Joy Of The Game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that's out of my system. I might stop writing for a bit until I'm angry again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-hnnnnngh"&gt;IV. HNNNNNGH.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, and don't even fucking get me &lt;em&gt;started&lt;/em&gt; on PowerBI -&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/strategy-doesnt-matter-if-you-blunder-every-move/</guid></item><item><title>My Wild Experience Interviewing with Real Engineers</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/my-wild-experience-interviewing-with-real-engineers/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I had my first interview with a &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; tech company - the kind that isn't Google but actually has some name recognition amongst people deeply into the tech space. It starts normal and promising, and then fucking &lt;em&gt;derails&lt;/em&gt; in spectacular fashion. Strap yourselves in, this is a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i-details-on-the-company"&gt;I. Details On The Company&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reasons of anonymity and politeness, I won't identify them outright in public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, a friend who earns The Big Bucks (TM) linked me to &lt;a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-salaries-in-the-netherlands-and-europe/"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; on the trimodal nature of salaries in tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lifted straight from the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="trimodal-salary-distribution.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/a9cfdde1.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those reading over email, the article posits there are three types of company with regards to salaries. Tier 1 competes with local companies in the same domain, Tier 2 competes with &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; local companies, and Tier 3 competes with all companies at the regional or global level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I earn enough money that salary is boring, and I'm not even particularly good... and am 29, immigrated here with no network, and am non-white. This is the upside to a dysfunctional industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no, what I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; interested in is working at places where I'm happy and no one is going to make me miserable. I've worked at Tier 1 companies my whole life, and this was my first time interviewing with a Tier 2 place. And from an engineering perspective, they were &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; better than anywhere I'd ever worked. Maybe it wouldn't be stupid? How high up the competence ladder do you have to go before you're not dealing with the stupid stuff I outline in my other writing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-how-i-got-an-interview"&gt;II. How I Got An Interview&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone, we need to talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sending your CV out looking for a job is only a good idea if you've recently immigrated or have a CV that fucks so hard that I'm not convinced such a thing exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are people better at this than I am, but I'm &lt;em&gt;pretty good at this&lt;/em&gt;, so this is going to be a process upgrade for most readers, even the short version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You call and email every goddamn person that thinks well of you. Then you sit back and get a job. It's &lt;em&gt;really easy&lt;/em&gt;. If another person comes up to me, sadly bemoaning that their CV keeps getting rejected, I am going to fling them out of a window in the desperate hope that they might network with one of the paramedics on the way to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company I'm talking about gets &lt;em&gt;hundreds&lt;/em&gt; of applicants for every opening, pays well above the local market rate... and I got an interview without ever seeing the position description. How? I played video games with someone that worked there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My CV &lt;em&gt;also gets bounced every time I send it out&lt;/em&gt;. So I don't send it out. All the time spent sending it out? Just stop and touch grass with other people, the job will sort itself out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-interview-1-all-good-so-far"&gt;III. Interview 1 - All Good So Far&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four stage interview process, baby, let's go! I don't know how trustworthy the sources I'm using are, but I'm apparently in the 93rd percentile of salaries in my country. The toughest interview question in my current role was "Do you know Python?" asked by a man that didn't have enough knowledge to verify my answer. If that sounds stupid, remember that we're also big enough that &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-accidentally-saved-half-a-million-dollars/"&gt;we use Snowflake&lt;/a&gt;, and badly at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first call was some sort of screening situation with HR. They were pleasant enough. I told them that I play the piano, and stubbed the little toes on both my feet that morning. This was enough humanity to be moved along. However, they &lt;em&gt;refused&lt;/em&gt; to progress things until I disclosed my salary expectations, despite the normal playbook of "I think that can wait until it's good fit, bla bla bla, what the role requires."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, if you have a good playbook for this, hit me up at ludicity.hackernews@gmail.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-interview-2-confidence-going-up"&gt;IV. Interview 2 - Confidence Going Up&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next they give me a take-home technical interview. &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is what I was worried about. I know that I'm not stupid, and I work with many smart individuals (we only become stupid as a collective), but 1/4th of my career was spent with a team that used network drives with folders named after dates for version control. So I am understandably nervous that &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; engineers are going to be operating on a dimension so far removed from my sad mortal plane that I am going to get the &lt;em&gt;Raiders of the Lost Ark&lt;/em&gt; treatment the moment I even glimpse their questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nope. Nope. Nope.&lt;/em&gt; It is &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; easy. It was one of the easiest Python questions I've solved in my life, and SQL that shouldn't challenge anyone who has used it for more than a year and read about some advanced features for two hours. The only requirement was enough brainpower to test both input and output to a function sensibly, do some window functions, and write some appropriate logging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this, because I wrote bad SQL for about two years of my career, then read about advanced features for two hours this year before the interview. I spent more time setting up the database to test my answers than on the actual questions, because &lt;a href="https://github.com/codeforkjeff/dbt-sqlite"&gt;this library&lt;/a&gt; was bugged at the time I was trying the exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling good, but still a little bit nervous. I've developed all my ideas around programming from thinking, discussions with a colleague that graduated at the same time as me, and a handful of tech talks. For example, they requested test coverage for the Python, a thing that I've &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; ever used in hobby projects because my employers are circuses and I am merely the lead clown. Did I write good ones?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v-interview-3-everyone-is-impressed-with-each-other"&gt;V. Interview 3 - Everyone Is Impressed With Each Other&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third interview is a discussion of my answers with two awesome engineers. I was blown away by how savvy and personable they were. Lots of cool stories too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They ask a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of hard questions about my Python, namely around why I decided to do things in particular ways. Why did you write your tests this way instead of using an awesome library I'd never heard about? Did you know you could do this particular thing with pytest? Why did you do your SQL this way? Why two functions here instead of one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things quickly became apparent. One was that they had years of experience on me doing things the right way, and have socialized that knowledge with each other in a way that would be hard for me to compete with in my little incompetence bubble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And secondly... it didn't really matter. I mean, they were &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; and I showed them a fair bit of deference, but they clearly had an actual appreciation for my skills, which was &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; for my confidence. And a lot of things I could answer from first principles by just asking for time to think. So they were good, but so was I! Without needing to learn at the feet of masters for years! My brain &lt;em&gt;hadn't&lt;/em&gt; rotted completely!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A concrete example - they ask me how I would write tests for SQL. Nowhere I've worked has ever done this, we just let it be wrong because we have fake jobs. I had to think - &lt;a href="https://github.com/calogica/dbt-expectations"&gt;dbt supports tests for uniqueness in columns&lt;/a&gt;, but that isn't the same as a test for business logic. The only way I can think of to do this, after taking about twenty seconds to reflect, is write views that check for correctness. I posited that solution, then said "I'm sure that there's a better way, because it seems ugly to have to maintain that many database objects."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out that's exactly what they do, and you just deal with it by being competent engineers and not letting all your tests lie down in the forest and allowing the moss to reclaim them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am genuinely getting emotional right now thinking about these people out there actually doing their jobs correctly, without being shitty to each other and talking about Agile all day. May they live long and prosper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vi-interview-4-lets-derail-this-train-baby"&gt;VI. Interview 4 - Let's Derail This Train, Baby&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next interview is &lt;em&gt;literally right after this one&lt;/em&gt;. Those two engineers drop out of the call, and two extremely senior people jump in for some behavioral interviewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within one minute, I immediately infer that the more senior of the two, a real important person at the company, is one of us, the wearied masses that sit around sadly repeating "But why don't we just solve the problem?" as hundreds of people insist that we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; while frantically scheduling Teams meeting with no agendas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know how to describe this, but I think the readers that email me will understand - we perform the weird spidermen-sense-each-other move, the strange secret mental handshake that everyone who emails me has already performed, where we can both immediately tell that we could work together without making each other fucking miserable. I'm pretty sure that the job is mine within the first twenty minutes. I think the exact secret handshake moment was roughly as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CTO: "So how do you approach problems?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: "This will sound strange, but I sometimes tell junior engineers to 'Do right thing instead of wrong thing. I know that sounds like absolute nonsense, but please, for the love of God, just do right thing, not wrong thing.'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me and CTO soul-meld for three seconds and emerge shaken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things stood out as weird though. One, the CTO was basically &lt;em&gt;begging&lt;/em&gt; for someone that would, quote, say they were going to solve a problem, and then &lt;em&gt;actually try to solve it&lt;/em&gt; and let them know if they get stuck, instead of just stopping at the first block. That was weird, because the two people I just spoke to were awesome. What's going on here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vii-sound-of-train-crashing"&gt;VII. &lt;em&gt;Sound Of Train Crashing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's all downhill from here, &lt;em&gt;woooo!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: "I've worked at $BAD_COMPANIES for a while, which simply don't operate on the same level. How do you handle employee stress and burnout?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CTO: &amp;lt;INSERT GREAT ANSWER&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: "Has anyone left due to burnout in the past year?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CTO: "We've had people leave for competitors at higher pay, but not due to burnout. We take that very seriously."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the &lt;em&gt;other person&lt;/em&gt; comes out of the gate fucking &lt;em&gt;swinging&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Person: "We don't pressure anyone, but I personally woke up at 3AM to start working because I love this product so much."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AAAAAA. RED ALERT. RED ALERT.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watch as the CTO listens to this in dismay. I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; this company doesn't make people work at 3 AM because I have a friend there, so I'm not that upset, but I am &lt;em&gt;loving&lt;/em&gt; their horror. I node sagely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, Jesus Christ, just fucking imagine saying that in front of someone - an executive - after a new hire, that everyone clearly wants to bring aboard, asks about stress &lt;em&gt;at the literal final stage of the process&lt;/em&gt;. That is up there, along with "We work hard and play hard" and "We work hard because we're family". I'd be so ashamed that I'd never be able to look my manager in the eye again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They backpedal as fast as possible, with Other Person realizing how thoroughly they've screwed up, with lots of sentences like "Of course, there's no &lt;em&gt;expectation&lt;/em&gt; you pull hours like that! I may have started at 3 AM, but I finished at 2 PM!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy &lt;em&gt;fuck&lt;/em&gt;, my buddy over here just panicked and accidentally said they only worked 11 hours starting at 3 AM so they're &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt;. They probably didn't, but I am &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt; for the chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CTO thanks me for my time and ends the call &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; at the end of the scheduled slot in a desperate bid to stop the bleeding. I immediately break down laughing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="viii-intermezzo"&gt;VIII. Intermezzo&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tell my current employer that I am not actively looking for work, but am probably about to receive a 40% raise. They say they absolutely can't swing the money, and promise to address my other concerns around workflow if I stay (spoiler: I knew they wouldn't, which is why I ask for money).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ix-hr-tries-their-bullshit"&gt;IX. HR Tries Their Bullshit&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know it's a long story when I had to Google how to do the Roman numeral for 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am informed by my friend that not only did I get the job, I &lt;em&gt;annihilated&lt;/em&gt; the competition. The phrases used were "nuked from orbit" and "parked my fleet in orbit and turned the planet into glass". Turns out that &lt;em&gt;not stupid&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;not stupid&lt;/em&gt; everywhere, and even higher-tier companies still hire mortals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HR calls me the same day to offer me the job... and inform me they've identified me as being at the &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; of their senior scale. This is called &lt;em&gt;lying&lt;/em&gt;. I say I want more money, they start bringing up my earlier salary expectations, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe the technical term for the move I then perform is "putting your dick on the table", because I say that it doesn't really make sense to talk about the value I'd add with a non-specialist, so I'd appreciate a call from the CTO. They are upset, but I thank them for their patience in dealing with such an uncomfortable topic, then go back to playing board games with my friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HR is not your friend.&lt;/em&gt; Always remember that. I don't remember anyone at university that was deeply passionate about getting HR, and that probably tells you everything you need to know about the kind of person that typically bumbles into it. I can't even imagine lying, straight-faced, to a professional lawyer about their interview performance and then trying to argue with them despite knowing jack shit about the field, but HR &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; tries this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I am tarring and feathering a massive industry filled with real humans with rich inner lives. Just don't get to know them, like I have successfully avoided doing, and you never have to feel guilty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CTO &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; call me and a few things happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The company can probably meet the money I want, which is more than the super good engineers I mentioned earlier earn because I am a new hire. I wonder why most companies can't retain good staff? This isn't this person's fault though&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, they won't let me work part-time, which is how I stay sane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They privately share intel on their inner operations that reveal to me that it's &lt;em&gt;still fucked enough&lt;/em&gt; to drive me to despair if I was there full-time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have a huge laugh over the "I work Saturdays thing" and are going to get drinks together - the Saturday Person is apparently reasonably cool incidentally, just not one of us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HR comes back to me with the money, and I say I don't want it. They want to find a workaround, and I don't because I only want to work part-time. That's right, dickheads, I don't negotiate with terrorists, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; if they opened by lying to me. I turned down like a 50% raise because anyone that tries to open negotiations that way and was willing to pay a new hire more than the existing staff ("there's no budget!") can go fuck themselves. My soul &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have a price and it's a 300% raise, you motherfuckers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that it reflects poorly on people internally to lose the best candidate this late in the game, and the inconvenience I'm causing the penny-pinchers feels like a modicum of justice for those poor, underpaid, disrespected people that interviewed me. Apparently they've been begging for years. Godspeed, you glorious sons of bitches, and don't let the bastards grind you down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="x-the-aftermath"&gt;X. The Aftermath&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm in touch with some of the people I interviewed with, and they're awesome. One of the engineers is taking a break from the company to work on something more meaningful, and I like to think that I was at least a small factor in that decision, if only by fueling their rage with the higher offer. Another one is joining me in trying to get a business off the ground. That's right, I interviewed at an A-tier company and then &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; staff joined &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently no one has passed the super easy technical interview I described above, even out of the candidates that get through the first-pass filtering, and most hires are now done with words to the effect of "They're no Ludic, but I guess they're okay."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, if people thought I was arrogant &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt;, my ego is through the roof now. And again, &lt;em&gt;I'm not even that good&lt;/em&gt;, I'm just constantly being reminded that the bar is below the floor. Please, go get &lt;em&gt;paid&lt;/em&gt; and demand some respect from these absolute losers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my current employer... remember how they decided there was no budget to give me that raise? Literally a month later, &lt;em&gt;after I would have left if this new place offered me part-time work&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-accidentally-saved-half-a-million-dollars/"&gt;that's when I saved them half a million dollars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="scorpion-frog.jpg" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/bd9d4aa2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/my-wild-experience-interviewing-with-real-engineers/</guid></item><item><title>What The Goddamn Hell Is Going On In The Tech Industry?</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/what-the-goddamn-hell-is-going-on-in-the-tech-industry/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Sweet merciful Jesus, I woke up this morning and my inbox was flooded with horrific stories about how employers treat people. I knew things were fucked, but this was &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much worse than I imagined, and that's not even getting into the comments on Hackernews. I am going to dig into some of those emails, but first...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually don't waste time on the negative comments because &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; the person making it has obviously gulped down so much corporate Kool-aid that I am afraid they will projectile vomit Agile terminology all over me, but there was &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; that was so funny that I had to share it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-accidentally-saved-half-a-million-dollars/"&gt;With regards to my post on saving half a million dollars&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a high likelihood that many other people in the org were lightyears ahead of the author. It's even more likely that an engineer or manager in their group was "Banking" the inefficiencies to use during a cost-cutting period - and the author ruined that chance... which will inevitably cause massive suffering and possibly poor performance reviews when there is nothing to trim."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brother in Christ, I have a blog that is largely about corporate dysfunction and the soul-cost it imposes on well-meaning engineers, and you think that &lt;em&gt;I'm the problem because someone else was deliberately wasting money so that they could pretend to save it later&lt;/em&gt;? In the words of the late Hitchens, "Do you see what brain rot descends on people?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally that wasn't what was happening here, they really just never checked the database defaults. I'm sure someone is out there by 5-dimensional hyper-chess by deliberately going over the budget by a billion percent, but rest assured that this is not the simplest explanation. The whole idea that management must have a reason to do something this stupid is something I toyed with for a while, but it really only applies to the minority of cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i-were-just-wasting-like-30-90-of-all-technical-productivity"&gt;I. We're Just Wasting Like 30-90% Of All Technical Productivity&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am near &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; convinced that the vast majority of our species' ability to produce things of value for the human race is just utterly squandered at large companies. I suspected we were wasting about 50%, but the volume of stories I got, frequently from &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; companies, including some of the FAANG places that mere normal engineers like me look up at in awe while we worship at the altar of StackOverflow, just blew my mind. A lot of them involved doing variations of almost exactly what I did in different stacks, and every single time management just buried what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you recognize yourself in these emails but didn't give me permission to write an email, then it &lt;em&gt;isn't actually you&lt;/em&gt;, it turns out these stories are so similar that they really do sound the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few stories about idling EC2 instances, totaling a total of about $4,000,000 saved &lt;em&gt;per month&lt;/em&gt;, which management buried to avoid looking bad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another guy that discovered the same optimisations I made, with the same result from management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some security guys that just... I don't even know what to say about these stories, but &lt;em&gt;quite a few&lt;/em&gt; stories were about finding out that a large proportion of a company's servers were infected with malware or mining cryptocurrency, which management, guess what, buried.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A guy, whose story deserves a whole post on its own, involving being told he's "not a team player" because he didn't stop someone else from flooding a server with crypto-bots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some people discovering other multi-million dollar optimisations that were ignored because they didn't have admin credentials, so they had to write suggestions which were ignored.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some others, with a handful &lt;em&gt;genuinely&lt;/em&gt; seeming to possibly add up to &lt;em&gt;billions&lt;/em&gt; of dollars saved industry-wide, but the largest payout anyone ever received in the emails was $5K. Sampling bias, yadda yadda, listen, I'm pretty sure things are just fucked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best story, which I have verified is true beyond all reasonable doubt, involved &lt;em&gt;literally saving a colleague's life with immense personal effort and in traumatic circumstances&lt;/em&gt;, which was rewarded by &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; getting the rest of the day off and $50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like what the fuck is going on out there? I mean, I guess we already &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; what's going on out there - keeping a large company efficient is actually an unsolvable problem. I suspect that if you want to build a modern GPU, you just have to be able to sustain all that inefficiency or... you don't get to have anything that takes more than 50 people (or something in that range) to make. It's just all so much worse than I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, while a lot of those stories were bad, most of them &lt;em&gt;probably weren't the worst places&lt;/em&gt; because most of the readers here are actually super talented engineers, which was evident from their excellent writing skills, open source contributions, and rugged good looks. The worst places &lt;em&gt;wouldn't have any talented engineers&lt;/em&gt;. Like, Christ, let that sink in. It's like thinking you're in Hell with a few other people, desperately hanging on, then realizing that just in the next room is Super Hell which consists entirely of demons torturing each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ack, it makes my skin crawl just thinking about it. There's a team out there where the main drama isn't one right faction and one wrong faction, there are &lt;em&gt;two factions fighting to the death over how best to use a spreadsheet as a database for a production application&lt;/em&gt;. I feel like this has to be stopped but I don't have the strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is fucking &lt;em&gt;awful&lt;/em&gt; out there. Maybe we should set up a support group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-the-other-side"&gt;II. The Other Side&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing I wanted to highlight is that there were &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; kinds of respondents, both via email and on Hackernews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first type, &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/compliments/"&gt;my favourite commenters&lt;/a&gt;, whose grim-faced no-nonsense corporate visages grace standups across the world. Thanks to their fearless leadership and keen business sense, I have it on good authority that all projects are scheduled to move from red status to green status despite all those risks unfortunately materializing, which is no one's fault in particular. Despite the various challenges we have faced over the years and lack of forward progress, I think &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; retro is the one where things are going to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second type, the vast majority, who read this stuff and immediately suffer flashbacks. My heart goes out to you, my kin. As a few people wrote in, don't let the bastards grind you down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the mythical third type, who &lt;em&gt;aren't sure whether my stories are real&lt;/em&gt;. Like, they just &lt;em&gt;assume&lt;/em&gt; that I must be making stuff up, because how could &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; do their work so ineffectively? God, I wish I was them. I read stories similar to mine and can just tell that they're true. I really, really wish I couldn't - if only I could toggle my brain back to that sweet pre-employment state, where I knew there would be some minor inefficiencies and I'd have a great time tackling them. Before I realized that wasting ten years of someone's career on a task that doesn't need to be done is actually a rounding error for many companies, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; that some absolute clowns would spend all their time trying to gaslight their peers into believing the work was accomplishing anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the third type are obviously actually also working at really stupid companies, but just accept the social fiction. It's probably good for them. However many of the others &lt;em&gt;actually work somewhere functional&lt;/em&gt;, and their experience is so far divorced from the average engineer's that I only have &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; friend that has worked at both a good and a bad place - and I keep a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of friends in the tech space between being pretty extroverted and this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's just some massive unwashed mass of utterly stupid companies where nothing makes any sense, and the only efficiencies exist in the department that generates the money to fund the other stupid stuff, and then a few places doing things &lt;em&gt;halfway&lt;/em&gt; right. The places doing things right tend to be characterized by being small, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; being obsessed with growth, and having calm, compassionate founders who still keep a hand on the wheel. And the people that work there &lt;em&gt;tend not to know the people that work elsewhere&lt;/em&gt;. They're just in some blessed bubble where the dysfunction still exists in serious quantities, but that quantity is like 1/10th the intensity of what it is elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it's really hard to tell these people apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, what I'm saying is, hold out hope. I'm aiming to keep a few conversations going with people via email that have made the jump, and I'm hoping to write up a guide on how to most effectively follow suit. If I can help even a handful of readers connect with like-minded peers and escape their hellish office settings, that would be enough good to last me a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plus&lt;/em&gt; then I can probably do some corporate backstabbing and stay karma-positive. Take me to management, baby, I want to buy an expensive hammock.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/what-the-goddamn-hell-is-going-on-in-the-tech-industry/</guid></item><item><title>I Accidentally Saved Half A Million Dollars</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-accidentally-saved-half-a-million-dollars/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I saved my company half a million dollars in about five minutes. This is more money than I've made for my employers over the course of my entire career because this industry is a sham. I clicked about five buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's talk about why happened and why it's a disgrace that it was even possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i-background"&gt;I. Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with some background, because it is fucking &lt;em&gt;wild&lt;/em&gt; that an inefficiency that took me five minutes to solve in a GUI configuration panel was allowed to persist. We &lt;em&gt;cancelled someone's contract&lt;/em&gt; the week before I did this. &lt;em&gt;Someone lost their job&lt;/em&gt; because no one could get their act together long enough to click the button I told them to click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, this company decided that it wanted to create an analytics platform, following the decision to become more "data driven". They hired some incredibly talented people to make this happen, and then like five times as many idiots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time this was happening, I had just graduated and joined the organization as a data scientist. We, of course, did not do any data science, because the organization did not require any data science to be done - what they actually needed to do was fire most of the staff in every team, leaving behind the two people who actually had good domain knowledge, then allow them to collaborate with good engineering teams to build sensible processes and systems. Instead, they hired a bunch of Big Firm Consultants. You can see where this is going already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, at the time I was young and took the organization at its word. Executives would tell us constantly how excited they were for us to roll out new A.I initiatives (then tell us there was no time, so could we please get that report to them in a spreadsheet), and I'd ask for some sort of compute to &lt;em&gt;perform&lt;/em&gt; some machine learning, or even set up data pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It never worked. Instead, we were told that we just had to wait for the Advanced Analytics Platform (AAP) to be deployed. You see, it's December, and it's launching in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in January I was told to be patient, it was coming in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, I was told it had been put on hold due to Covid - this was a very convenient excuse because they had absolutely fucked the whole project up already, but it bought some valuable time. By the next December, I had left the organization and the AAP was still nowhere to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We skip ahead three years. The AAP is finally ready to launch. It turns out none of the features I needed were ever planned, so I guess they were just lying to me before I left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four engineers leave the company in the same week, and I speak with the directors because I know they need a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; engineer in and they can't find them. I'm a substantially less experienced engineer than many of the readers here, but suffice it to say that I can read documentation without panicking, which is considered S-tier in this country. My conditions - a big pile of money and they had to put me on the AAP team because they're the only team that gets actual toys to play with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-it-fucking-sucks"&gt;II. It Fucking Sucks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's an insane dumpster fire spiderweb of technical debt and it's only like one week old. Here are some fun details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get a friend of mine hired (big fan of nepotism), and he finds, &lt;em&gt;on day one&lt;/em&gt;, a file in the project's repository that deletes prod using our CI/CD pipelines if it is ever moved into the wrong folder. It comes complete with the key and password required for an admin account. It was produced by the former lead engineer, who has moved on to a new role before his sins catch up with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire thing is stitched together by spreadsheets that are parsed by Python, dropped into S3, parsed by Lambdas into more S3, the S3 files are picked up by MongoDB, then MongoDB records are passed by another Lambda into S3, the S3 files are pulled into Snowflake via Snowpipe, the new Snowflake data is pivoted by a Javascript stored procedure into a relational format... and that's how you edit someone's database access. That whole process is to upload like a 2KB CSV to a database that has people's database roles in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is considered &lt;em&gt;more auditable&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is transformed into a CSV because the security team demanded something that could undergo easy scanning for malicious content, then they never deployed the scanning tool, so we have all the downsides of the CSVs and none of the upsides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every Lambda function, the backbone of all the ETL pipelines, starts with &lt;code&gt;counter = 1&lt;/code&gt; because one of the early iterations &lt;em&gt;used to use a counter&lt;/em&gt; and people have just been copying that line over and over. &lt;em&gt;Senior data engineers&lt;/em&gt; have been copying that line over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test suites in the CI/CD pipelines have been failing for months, because someone during debugging chose to use the Linux &lt;code&gt;tee&lt;/code&gt; command to log any errors to both &lt;code&gt;stdout&lt;/code&gt; and a file at the same time, but &lt;code&gt;tee&lt;/code&gt; successfully executing was overwriting the error code from the failing tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get access to the password for any API we need to hit, you search for something like &lt;code&gt;service-password&lt;/code&gt; in an AWS service, which returns the value... &lt;code&gt;service-password&lt;/code&gt; (as in, literally all the values are the same as the keys), then you use &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; to look up the actual password in a completely different service. No one knows why we do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script that generates configuration files for our pipelines starts with 600 lines of comments, because senior engineers have been commenting the lines out in case they're needed later. The lines are just setting the same variables to different values, and they're all on GitHub anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is at an organization that some percentage of readers will recognize on sheer brand strength if they're in my country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not even getting started, but we have to stop for now because I am going to catch fire. These details are important because now you understand the kind of operational incompetence that allows you to waste so much money on processing &amp;lt;1TB of data per day that it dwarfs your team's salary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-the-budget"&gt;III.  The Budget&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing to realize is that this platform never really had a chance of making any money for the organization. They do a little accounting trick (read: lying) which I'll talk about in another post that makes it seem like they've had huge wins, but really this is just many times more expensive than our previous operational model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal is that we pretend the whole team is doing something or other, and we stay within budget because the organization can't afford to spend infinite money on this social fiction. However, the budget for our database costs was being drastically overrun. I'm not sure what the original estimate was, but I think it was intended to cost something like 200K for a year of operations, but we were now close to a million dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some quick facts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We use Snowflake as our database, which charges you based on the size of the computer you use to run your queries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You only pay for computers while they're on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We probably run a few thousand queries per week, mostly developers experimenting with little tweaks for PowerBI reports that no one reads, and on average they take about 2 seconds to run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The computers are set to idle for 10 minutes after every query&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed this about a month into joining the team, and suggested we uh... don't have the computers run for like two orders of magnitude longer than they need to for every query. I literally can't remember what was said, there was some Agile bullshit about doing a discovery piece, then it just never happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-just-doing-the-fucking-thing"&gt;IV. Just Doing The Fucking Thing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, &lt;em&gt;months&lt;/em&gt; later, they finally give me a card that says "Discovery: Optimise Costs". Now I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to optimize costs so that I have something to say at the next standup, and fortunately I know just the thing! I'll test my hypothesis that this is all a sick joke, and I'm going to push the button that I secretly think should obviously have been pushed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've got a new guy on another team who seems excellent, so I ask management if I can give him admin credentials since we need competent people. They say no. I flick him some lower-level database credentials that I &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; wasn't told not to do since they aren't admin credentials, and he sanity-checks that it would save money. At 4PM on the last day of the week, I ping a chat full of good engineers and no managers to make sure I'm not about to nuke everything, then just do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v-chaos-reigns"&gt;V.  Chaos Reigns&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I return to work the following Monday. I &lt;em&gt;suspected&lt;/em&gt; that this would save a bunch of money, and guess what, our projected bill dropped from a million to half a million dollars, and everyone is losing their fucking minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My team has spun this as a huge cost saving, when &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; we just applied a fire extinguisher to the pile of money that we had set alight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other teams are attacking my team, insisting that it can't be a coincidence that the one new guy joined exactly as we did this, and how was it possible we didn't know how to generate that kind of saving without his help? They are saying this because it makes them seem higher status and their teams only produce money in the land where you lie all day, but it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a fair question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While my managers are very happy, they quietly suggest it may be unwise to roll out the changes to all the computers (I only did a few to be safe) because it would oversaturate the department to hear about us all day. And invite unwelcome questions. The subtext is that if we do this all slowly enough, it might seem like it took a lot of effort instead of just clicking buttons that I said had to be clicked almost a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am asked to write some PowerPoints, which include phrases like "a careful statistical analysis of user usage patterns indicated an opportunity to more effectively allocate resources", implying that nothing was &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;, we just needed to collect more data before deciding not to let the expensive machines idle all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day, I dread someone asking me to explain what the change was, because I will have to fucking &lt;em&gt;yeet&lt;/em&gt; some managers I like under a bus, but they can't resist talking about the change non-stop because it is the closest some of them will ever get to impacting the bottom line. And &lt;em&gt;many of them are actually decent managers&lt;/em&gt;, it's just that this whole department, like many departments, is some sort of weird political PsyOp to get executives promoted. It's &lt;em&gt;cosplaying as a real business&lt;/em&gt; and the board thinks the costume is convincing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vi-the-aftermaths-and-takeaways"&gt;VI. The Aftermaths and Takeaways&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By identifying a handful of good engineers and going totally rogue, we outperformed the entire department pretty effortlessly. The competent people are there, just made totally impotent by the organization, and I'm still convinced that this place is probably better than the median organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ask management for a 30K raise after saving 500K and my message is still unread. I suspect I will eventually receive either nothing or 5K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have even more meetings now because everyone wants to talk about how we saved the money. I had to make a PowerPoint. Kill me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would have been better off &lt;em&gt;not doing anything&lt;/em&gt;. Let that be a lesson to you. Do you hear me? I applied myself for &lt;em&gt;five minutes&lt;/em&gt; against my own better judgement, had the greatest success of my career, and have immediately been punished for it. &lt;em&gt;Learn from my mistakes, I beg of you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-accidentally-saved-half-a-million-dollars/</guid></item><item><title>The Empty Hall Of Smiling Assassins</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/an-empty-hall-of-smiling-assassins/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This year,  I've attended my first two large tech conferences. One was hosted by a trendy database vendor, and the other was a general tech conference in a non-hub that no one &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; know about. Despite some highlights, I would describe both experiences as "grotesque", "troubling", and "oily". Or, to quote a friend upon reporting in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conferences are an empty hall of smiling assassins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point I should unpack the terrible life choices that have led me to a place where I have opinions on the relative trendiness of databases, but for now, &lt;em&gt;let's talk about the miserable state of our industry, babyyyyy!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i-ten-thousand-snakes-in-a-suit"&gt;I. Ten Thousand Snakes In A Suit&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the trendy database conference - one of the keynote speakers runs a major customer loyalty program, which as a non-specialist I believe is code for "we sell all your purchasing data in the hopes that people who can't do math don't realize our rewards are worth like $200 over your entire lifespan". If you are a specialist, I will accept corrections but also, I dunno, fuck you on principle I guess. You might not deserve that, but it's a Monday and I just had to go through standup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This person breathlessly took the stage and spoke happily about how they've had almost 10% year-on-year growth because of the crippling increases in rent and groceries driving the working class to seek savings wherever they could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very cool and normal, and also fuck you on principle, even if it isn't a Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They then continued to talk about the &lt;em&gt;thrill&lt;/em&gt; of seeing that family finally purchase that vacuum cleaner that was always aspirational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, fuck you, and also I hope you fall down a flight of stairs. I swear to God, I can't even imagine what kind of defective software you have to be running in your brain to be that tone-deaf, but I was deeply concerned to see this is what our bajillionaire class is doing. It's a super concerning blend of being a complete sellout &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; too goddamn stupid to even hide it well. How hard is it to get on a stage without sounding like a Disney villain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the CEO of a company with &lt;em&gt;millions&lt;/em&gt; of users and they've got their head so far up their ass that they don't realize how fucking demented they sound when they say that they're ecstatic over their great growth caused by people needing help to afford basic cleaning appliances. I think the worst part was realizing that &lt;em&gt;this didn't flag for some people in the audience&lt;/em&gt;, even techies. Some part of their brain just turned off and went "10% year-on-year growth? That's &lt;em&gt;money&lt;/em&gt;. And look how important that person on the stage is! I wish I got attention!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most importantly, can't we like, get &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; sociopaths in here? What kind of idiots are we pulling into the C-suite? The &lt;em&gt;obviously correct&lt;/em&gt; play is to sadly discuss your massive growth as indicative of sadder trends in society, and then even more sadly say that you hope to see things turn around. And you're &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; happy to be able to help, even just a little bit, in the meantime, and you're providing tons of feedback to the government on how to ease spending pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, fuck you for being evil, and double fuck you for being incompetently evil. Take some pride in your malice, you craven snake-dog. Society needs craftspeople, and you're letting your whole fucked team down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-logging"&gt;II. Logging&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time I spoke to someone in the C-suite that wasn't a sane friend or family member, they asked my whole team "What they thought about logging?", asked if we should buy a product they had read about on LinkedIn that does some logging, then said "Why don't people take pride in their work anymore? I probably spend an hour every day on LinkedIn study."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember this the next time someone tells you that executives &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; deserve to be where they are, or why would they be there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-a-tragedy-in-three-parts"&gt;III. A Tragedy In Three Parts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's get to the good stuff. I fly to the smaller non-hub conference. Madness ensues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="act-1-fintech"&gt;Act 1: Fintech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am attending with a close friend who I haven't seen in years - I hop off the plane, zoom &lt;em&gt;straight&lt;/em&gt; to the first part of the conference which is fintech related. He's someone that I would like to go into business with, and we're hoping to network a little bit and find out about what the rest of the industry is like, especially the more competent parts. Fintech is going to be competent for sure, there's all that money at stake, we think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I am not sure how to describe this rationally so I'm not going to try, but the &lt;em&gt;air&lt;/em&gt; felt like someone had been operating some grease-filled humidifier, and I think this hit me because I walked in and immediately saw the event was sponsored by some dipshit crypto application. The funny thing is that rather than having blind hatred, I read &lt;em&gt;Mastering Ethereum&lt;/em&gt; for a bit because it would have been &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; convenient if I could actually just print money by finding some crypto use case that I'd be morally okay with, and &lt;em&gt;I just couldn't&lt;/em&gt;. So rather than blind hatred, my hatred has intense visual acuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, these people were fucking &lt;em&gt;crazy&lt;/em&gt;. One of the speakers, a man clearly into his 50s, talked about how he left his cushy job at a bank to... make his own bank... which seemed identical to the previous bank, except &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; owned it and their apps were better. He then spoke at length about the nights he slept at the hotel they had their only branch in - not like, in a &lt;em&gt;hotel room&lt;/em&gt; but &lt;em&gt;in the bank's physical branch&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fucking &lt;em&gt;go home&lt;/em&gt; dude, what the &lt;em&gt;fuck&lt;/em&gt; are you on about? Why is everyone impressed by this? This man &lt;em&gt;has a family and kids&lt;/em&gt;, why is he out here sleeping in a bank branch? This is not aspirational, this is the part of the Twilight Zone where LinkedIn posts are real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of it was equally stupid and uncomfortable. My favourite moment was the panel conversation, where we had one VC person (who seemed human) sandwiched on either side by four men who were running banking startups. Most of the panel consisted of them saying "hire well" and then making incredibly uncomfortable jokes about how some of them had received more VC money than the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important note is that we were then approached by a guy, who we will call Henry, that immediately blasted us with totally unsolicited advice on how to get our own business off the ground. I have received a lot of good unsolicited &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; solicited advice from readers of this blog (I like to think we all have impeccable taste and huge brains here), but this guy's advice was both terrible and patronizing, though his technical chops seemed decent. In any case, he makes sure that we have his cards as we spend twenty minutes trying to extricate ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He seems like he learned his social skills from Dale Carnegie, which is forgivable, but he thinks he's better than us, which is possibly but true but not forgivable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="act-2-the-industry-is-in-shambles"&gt;Act 2: The Industry Is In Shambles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second day starts with a phenomenal talk on free speech. It is absolutely fucking wasting on this audience, because this audience consists mostly of people that think a philosophy book needs to have the word 'Hope' somewhere in the title and all the text is in a size 24 font, as if the author is screaming affirmation directly into your mind. The rest of the opening speech is like, absolute bullshit. They keep talking about how 'quantum' is going to revolutionize everything without going into any specifics, and half the vendors here &lt;em&gt;literally provide training on how to use ChatGPT&lt;/em&gt;. You &lt;em&gt;chat&lt;/em&gt; with it, you clowns, it's in the name. And I'm pretty sure the main application of quantum anything in your industry is fucking all your encryption up, I don't know &lt;em&gt;but neither do you and I'm not running a massive company&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is at this point that I realize that, as silly as most of my employers typically are, we are somehow &lt;em&gt;still better than the average place&lt;/em&gt;. That is fucking &lt;em&gt;wild&lt;/em&gt; to me because operationally we are like toddlers - the only IDE we can be trusted with is a sheet of A4 and some crayons - but apparently there are people out here straight up finger painting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere around the halfway point of this day, we are despairing. We haven't met a single person that is remotely intelligent. We're in a standing-room-only talk where a man is breathlessly explaining that you can improve productivity in your workplace by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unsubscribe from excessive newsletters! They're distracting you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put your phone away, it's distracting you!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Block out some no meeting time, it's distracting you!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are packaged as &lt;em&gt;Tasty Tips&lt;/em&gt;, and you need to always remember to do things that &lt;em&gt;Move Your Boat Forward&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspiration strikes me. I pull my friend out of the room and we look for people in the lounge outside that look like they're texting their friends furiously about how fucking dumb that talk was. We approach the closest person, we all vent together, and I now talk to that guy every day. We spend the rest of the conference doing this, and it works &lt;em&gt;every goddamn time&lt;/em&gt;. There's a lesson here about operationalizing unorthodox strategies, but for now it's just funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our way out, Henry is there again. He tries to flag us down for conversation, but my friendly deftly says that we have somewhere to be. We then walk into a random room, but not before Henry makes sure we have his card again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That evening we attend post-event drinks. It ends up being us in a corner, with the cool, angry dude we met, and the keynote speakers on the human rights topics. Everyone here that isn't a total grifter has migrated to this one table and is hanging on for dear life. Henry, from his empty table that people can't seem to leave quickly enough, watches us with narrowed eyes. His entire demeanor reads as "Those upstarts that don't even run their own successful company - unlike &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; - actually have people that want to talk to them. &lt;em&gt;How dare they?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iii-leaving"&gt;III. Leaving&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third day is less cursed as we adopt our "avoid the talks and finding angry people" strategy. Highlights include meeting a delightful pair of marketers that &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; wanted to learn how machine learning can help their business, but it turns out that people have convinced them that the Venn diagram of machine learning and ChatGPT is a perfect circle. &lt;em&gt;This is the state the non-tech world lives in&lt;/em&gt;. But we help them out, and one of them approaches me later with a variant of "I heard you're studying psychology and this corporate world is soulless and vaguely pathetic - should I get into psychology too like I've been thinking?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is time to leave. We are in high spirits, and looking forward to two days at the beach. The event was extremely funny, killed a lot of the self-doubt we both carried with us, and we managed to come out of it with some close friends despite how fucked it all was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we leave the venue, a piece of paper on the ground catches my eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone has dropped Henry's business card, and it has been trampled underfoot by a dozen people.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/an-empty-hall-of-smiling-assassins/</guid></item><item><title>All My Favourite Reading</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/all-my-favourite-reading/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a list of all my favorite articles, accompanied by some brief discussion. I'd like to maintain a list like this somewhere to update periodically, along with the little notes, and notify readers if I've added anything particularly good. Let me know if you are aware of any good solutions for this at ludicity.hackernews@gmail.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i-patrick-mckenzies-career-advice"&gt;I. Patrick McKenzie's Career Advice&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick McKenzie, or patio11, has given me the greatest bang for my buck in terms of anything I've ever read about the realities of the software engineering industry. This article in particular is aimed at people new to software, but I suspect that some people never figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="i-most-software-is-unsexy"&gt;I. Most software is unsexy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first point on most software in the world being thoroughly unsexy was extremely useful to me, as they don't teach you at university that &lt;em&gt;most applications aren't YouTube&lt;/em&gt;. Most applications solve extremely boring problems, where boring means "this is not complicated at all and is basically a solved problem". The bit missing from McKenzie's writing here, that I'd like to add, is that &lt;em&gt;most companies can't solve solved problem&lt;/em&gt;. I know that's wild, but if you took the average big organization, they would be unable to get a simple CRUD app working in any reasonable state. This is why I know a doctor whose hospital spent millions getting a new interface to their medical record system up and running, and the application consist of ten pages and 200 fields, but you simply &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; access the tenth page without filling out the first nine, so the doctors click on every field one-at-a-time and enter a single character of whitespace before the patients come in so they can navigate freely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can build something like that &lt;em&gt;without fucking it up&lt;/em&gt; then you are doing &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;. I know that sounds stupid but it is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ii-be-attached-to-profit-centers"&gt;II. Be attached to Profit Centers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will deal with grifters no matter where you go - there is a Brotherhood of Morons out there in society, and their dimwitted visages curse every standups across the world. However, you will earn &lt;em&gt;way more money&lt;/em&gt; and have much less fake work if you're near the part of the business that actually generates revenue. At a big organization, this will be a small part of the business, but you should force your way in anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iii-dont-call-yourself-a-programmer"&gt;III. Don't call yourself a programmer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't call yourself a programmer. I cannot repeat this one enough, &lt;em&gt;do not call yourself a programmer&lt;/em&gt;. You have to see this from the perspective of a non-programming executive at the average place - &lt;em&gt;their teams can't build CRUD apps&lt;/em&gt;. Every time programmers get involved, things go wrong. &lt;em&gt;Don't be seen as a programmer&lt;/em&gt;. People think that programmers are just the weirdos who type the arcane runes into the computer, and the only reason a manager keeps them around is the ones who "understand people" are too busy kicking goals to learn the arcane runes. I would almost rather tell someone that I've been to jail than that I'm a programmer, because at least the former is interesting and not associated with tanking every project they've ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iv-programming-languages-dont-matter"&gt;IV. Programming languages don't matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless it's Rust, in which case re-write the whole company in Rust, babyyyyyyyy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="v-cvs-are-the-exception-for-job-offers"&gt;V. CVs are the exception for job offers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least a few readers have sent me their CVs to glance over in the hopes that they'll find a better gig. There are two issues with this. The first one is that I'm just some fucking guy, so what the heck do I have to say about this. The second one is that CVs &lt;em&gt;don't matter&lt;/em&gt; in almost all cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; received a job by just sending in my CV, including jobs where it is a legal requirement that this is the process that gets followed. The actual process is that I know someone senior at the company, we decide it would be a good fit, someone glances over my CV to make sure I was able to produce a single document without any typos, then we do the interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, one page CVs are optimal because I've heard all sorts of conflicting opinions from hiring managers at top firms, and my conclusion is that you don't want to work for anyone with a strong opinion on CV length, so you might as well just do the shortest one so you can edit it for a new gig quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vi-just-read-the-whole-thing"&gt;VI. Just read the whole thing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's so goddamn good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-salary-negotiation"&gt;II. Salary Negotiation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, you thought we were done with McKenzie? You fool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is too long to get into, but if you don't average at least $10-20K more than whatever the initial offer you get at an organization is, read this. Read it now. If you don't read it now, you will forget, and then you will be minus $10K (&lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt;) every year for the rest of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heck, I suspect that I'm doing it wrong, because I always get the amount of money I ask for, which means I'm not asking for enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-things-people-find-too-obvious-to-have-told-you-already"&gt;III. Things People Find Too Obvious To Have Told You Already&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're still not done, we will &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; be done, &lt;a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/936615043126370306.html"&gt;here's more McKenzie&lt;/a&gt;. This one is just a long list of facts about the tech industry, and reading it is like Matrix-flashing a few years of experience directly onto your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are attempting to hire for an engineering position, greater than 50% of people who apply for the job and whose resume you select as "facially plausible" will be entirely unable to program, at all. The search term for learning more about this is FizzBuzz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go ahead, tell me that Sturgeon's Law isn't a real thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical literacy in the broader population can be approximated with the Thanksgiving test: what sort of questions do you get at Thanksgiving? That's the ambient level of literacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serious people in positions of power eat Thanksgiving dinners, too. Guess what they ask at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-the-black-swan"&gt;IV. The Black Swan&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nassim Taleb's much-loved and much-reviled book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read this once when I was 18 and hated it, deciding the author was a pretentious dickhead. I read it again during a flight back home for the holidays, about two years later, and at this point had &lt;em&gt;become&lt;/em&gt; a pretentious dickhead so I could finally enjoy it in the spirit it was intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No book has been more impactful on my life. We are bombarded, day in and day out, by just-so theories on why events have shaken out the way they have and why they're going to go according to plan. I have seen many people argue that Taleb is just repeating himself, and he &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; very frequently, but my belief is that the repetition is necessary for internalizing. I meet a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of people who are familiar with this work in theory, but have never read it, and then continue to commit the same blunders over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also goes a long way towards inoculating you against executives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v-impro"&gt;V. Impro&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Impro-Improvisation-Theatre-Keith-Johnstone/dp/0878301178"&gt;this strange book&lt;/a&gt; by the late Keith Johnstone on improvised theatre around the time I was graduating. It is quite strange, and parts of it seemed utterly implausible to me (the parts on mask work). With a bit more life experience behind my belt, the parts on status are dead on, and the weird parts such as "mask work" are at least &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; plausible although I still find them strange and creepy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vi-how-to-get-promoted"&gt;VI. How to get promoted&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slava Akmechet's no-punches-pulled take on the realities of &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231129015851/https://www.spakhm.com/p/how-to-get-promoted"&gt;advancement at large corporations&lt;/a&gt;. This is a weird one because to me it is &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; written in total seriousness, but a few people think it's too cynical or a joke. I think it was &lt;em&gt;linked to me&lt;/em&gt; as a joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many readers incidentally directed me to this, though I had seen it before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="i-on-actually-doing-your-job"&gt;I. On actually doing your job&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company metrics have momentum and lag. Nearly all political behavior exploits these two properties. A metric in motion tends to remain in motion. Changing that requires good decisions, a lot of luck, and application of enormous force. And observing a metric is like observing light from a distant star— you're observing the work done in the past. So opportunists don't worry about any of that. The winning strategy is to ignore company metrics completely and move between projects every eighteen months so that nobody notices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wouldn't people notice anyway? Rank and file employees will, but not the management. In a fast growing company things change very quickly. There is a hurricane of activity. New projects and teams are constantly spun up, products launched, reorgs, valuations, office moves, new hires, funding rounds, customers lost and gained, offsites, PR victories and scandals— nobody can keep track of all of this. You can't remember what things looked like two weeks ago, let alone last quarter. Two years ago? Forget it! So long as you looked good at the time, nobody will remember what you did in your last role. And even if they do, people tend to attribute everything to the present. If you screwed up a project, switched roles, and it's only now apparent that the project is in trouble, the blame will naturally fall on its current leader, not on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So your job isn't to make good decisions to improve company metrics. It's to look good. That means you must understand basic tenets of human nature and learn to manipulate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ii-on-corporate-rituals"&gt;II. On corporate rituals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, while you shouldn't take performative rituals at face value, you must still perform them— enthusiastically and with gusto. In countries like Japan, Russia, and parts of Eastern Europe, to successfully work with someone you must drink with them. Drinking is a trust building ritual and a mechanism to signal that you are part of the in-group. No drinking, no promotion. In corporate America the lion's share of this signaling is done through proselytizing management technologies. Going to meetings, talking about KPIs, OKRs, collaboration, Agile— all are shibboleth to signal you're part of the in-group, in the same way drinking is an in-group signal in other parts of the world. No shibboleth, no promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vii-zen-and-the-art-of-motorcycle-maintenance"&gt;VII. Zen And The Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another book that I hated when I was younger, then looped all the way back around and decided was awesome. Seeing a pattern? I do my best to extrapolate and just assume that everything I think will be obviously wrong in five years... but I also can't just &lt;em&gt;decide to be wiser&lt;/em&gt; so I've decided to lean into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zen-Art-Motorcycle-Maintenance-Inquiry/dp/0060589469"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while Sylvia sits down on the wooden picnic bench and straightens out her legs, lifting one at a time slowly without looking up. Long silences mean gloom for her, and I comment on it. She looks up and then looks down again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It was all those people in the cars coming the other way,'' she says. "The first one looked so sad. And then the next one looked exactly the same way, and then the next one and the next one, they were all the same.''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They were just commuting to work.''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She perceives well but there was nothing unnatural about it. "Well, you know, work,'' I repeat. "Monday morning. Half asleep. Who goes to work Monday morning with a grin?''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's just that they looked so lost,'' she says. "Like they were all dead. Like a funeral procession.'' Then she puts both feet down and leaves them there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see what she is saying, but logically it doesn't go anywhere. You work to live and that's what they are doing. "I was watching swamps,'' I say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while she looks up and says, "What did you see?''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There was a whole flock of red-winged blackbirds. They rose up suddenly when we went by.''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Oh.''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ii"&gt;II.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What I wanted to say,'' I finally get in, "is that I've a set of instructions at home which open up great realms for the improvement of technical writing. They begin, `Assembly of Japanese bicycle require great peace of mind.' ''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This produces more laughter, but Sylvia and Gennie and the sculptor give sharp looks of recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's a good instruction,'' the sculptor says. Gennie nods too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's kind of why I saved it,'' I say. "At first I laughed because of memories of bicycles I'd put together and, of course, the unintended slur on Japanese manufacture. But there's a lot of wisdom in that statement.''
.
John looks at me apprehensively. I look at him with equal apprehension. We both laugh. He says, "The professor will now expound.''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Peace of mind isn't at all superficial, really,'' I expound. "It's the whole thing. That which produces it is good maintenance; that which disturbs it is poor maintenance. What we call workability of the machine is just an objectification of this peace of mind. The ultimate test's always your own serenity. If you don't have this when you start and maintain it while you're working you're likely to build your personal problems right into the machine itself.''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They just look at me, thinking about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's an unconventional concept,'' I say, "but conventional reason bears it out. The material object of observation, the bicycle or rotisserie, can't be right or wrong. Molecules are molecules. They don't have any ethical codes to follow except those people give them. The test of the machine is the satisfaction it gives you. There isn't any other test. If the machine produces tranquillity it's right. If it disturbs you it's wrong until either the machine or your mind is changed. The test of the machine's always your own mind. There isn't any other test.''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeWeese asks, "What if the machine is wrong and I feel peaceful about it?''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reply, "That's self-contradictory. If you really don't care you aren't going to know it's wrong. The thought'll never occur to you. The act of pronouncing it wrong's a form of caring.''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one hand, senpai noticed me. On the other hand, senpai didn't agree with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main complaints were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; affect change at your organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking down on people around you is unhealthy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why don't you just make a company then?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main things I wanted to note are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The man &lt;em&gt;doesn't know what Power BI is&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's a person that doesn't know what Power BI is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I become that person?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually patched up my incredibly shoddy algorithms knowledge by working through his excellent algorithms course (&lt;a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and my entire development environment is configured around his (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). I use &lt;a href="https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon"&gt;Harpoon&lt;/a&gt; all the time, which is fucking &lt;em&gt;sick&lt;/em&gt;, and we all say &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwUPs5N9I6I"&gt;"Tom is a genius!"&lt;/a&gt; whenever we enter the spreadsheet zone. I switched to i3 because of you, and this is how I am regarded? Oh, cruel fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be blown apart like that, by one of my idols in the technical space, has really taught me something about humility and -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="children_wrong.jpg" src="https://mataroa.blog/images/ef027d6f.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i-is-it-worth-responding"&gt;I. Is It Worth Responding?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, but only briefly, because it turns out we actually agree about everything once we've addressed three core things, and these are the objections to my perspective that come up over and over again. One is around whether you can change things, one is around looking down on people, and the last is "Why don't you just make a company, if you're so smart?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-you-can-affect-change-at-your-organization"&gt;II. You &lt;em&gt;Can&lt;/em&gt; Affect Change At Your Organization&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most &lt;em&gt;frustrating&lt;/em&gt; things about being in the &lt;em&gt;extremely large&lt;/em&gt; part of the tech space that is utterly dysfunctional is that &lt;em&gt;no one believes you&lt;/em&gt;. It just sounds so absurd. How inefficient could these huge companies actually be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I watched Office Space this year at a friend's recommendation, and the first half of the movie &lt;em&gt;was basically a documentary&lt;/em&gt; in spirit. How can you explain that to someone that hasn't experienced it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an asymmetry in how closely most of our experiences align with socially accepted reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, my precious, pure idol &lt;em&gt;doesn't know what Power BI is&lt;/em&gt;. Can you imagine how fucking &lt;em&gt;happy&lt;/em&gt; that dude must be all the time? Not "I don't use Power BI", he literally doesn't know what it is. I have never even met someone in the modern tech world that doesn't know what it is. The intersection of his experience with the average tech person's must be close to the empty set. This is not to say that he has had a privileged life - I suspect he has had a harder life than me despite being born in the first world - but in tech space, yes, he cannot understand what it is actually like for the masses. Netflix isn't a mythical fantasy-land (I have a few FAANG friends) but the distance between what actually happens there and what management &lt;em&gt;says&lt;/em&gt; happens there is relatively small... and I know he's had other, worse, jobs, but I'm guessing they actually produced a working product or he'd be agreeing with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That isn't a &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; thing at all, it's just that our position as people at regular companies is simply unbelievable to someone that has only worked at places that actually do things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, when &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; said that he has a great workplace that he got to by studying extremely hard, I believed him and &lt;em&gt;studied extremely hard&lt;/em&gt;, literally using his course. Hell, in the video above, he says that his manager is actually data driven, completely missing the point. His manager is the real deal &lt;em&gt;because he's at Netflix&lt;/em&gt;. The rest of the world is full of grifters that are using the same words as his manager with none of the insight because &lt;em&gt;they want to sound like Netflix managers&lt;/em&gt;. It is exceedingly hard to find work at a place that doesn't behave this way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(But also, I'm pretty sure most people can do it in first world countries with the correct application of effort, if they're either willing to take a pay cut or try get into Google, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I said "Hey man, did you know like 50% of tech jobs produce literally nothing of value other than helping corporate sociopaths and uncritical thinkers leech money?", his response was essentially "That sounds fucking &lt;em&gt;crazy&lt;/em&gt;, you must be the problem! Have you tried standing up for good standards at your workplace?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know it sounds crazy, but it is &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;. My brother in Christ, please, some symmetry of respect. The wave of commenters on that video aren't asocial dweebs who just didn't realize they need to use their words to convince people, they're victims. Last week, I was &lt;em&gt;inundated&lt;/em&gt; with emails from extremely intelligent, eloquent engineers who were just glad that someone said what they were all thinking. I was willing to accept that there's a magical land where people are largely incentivized correctly to make engineers happy, can't you accept that there's a world where everyone knows what Power BI is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in that world, no, you can't improve things without a massive cost to yourself. If it's something you really care about, sure, but I genuinely think it is actively harmful to convince someone that HR actually wants their third enterprise payroll system migration to be done to top-tier standards at Generic Widget Corp. HR actually wants you to do the migration super badly and under budget so they can report to the board that it was a success and managers get promoted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-looking-down-on-people-around-you-is-unhealthy"&gt;III. Looking Down On People Around You Is Unhealthy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing that people took massive issue with is the statement that 90% of things are crud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I didn't write Sturgeon's Law, and people seem to take it far too literally. It isn't saying that &lt;em&gt;literally 90% of all things suck&lt;/em&gt;, it's saying that a surprisingly large amount of content in any field is bad to anyone that has taken the time to develop an aesthetic sense around it. Have you at Kindle Unlimited?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a few exceptions, I don't think many of the people who cause these problems are stupid. &lt;em&gt;Stupid&lt;/em&gt; is usually just shorthand for &lt;em&gt;not doing things to align with the organization's stated goal&lt;/em&gt; which can be due to many things that aren't related to intelligence, but I was ranting so I picked the punchy word. Some of them are just dimwitted, some of them are burned out, many of them don't care, and some are extremely smart but also sociopaths. For the most part, they've got kids and families, and I don't begrudge them from hanging around. Some of them have &lt;em&gt;come up to me and said they don't care&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 90% of the databases I've worked with have had the schemas so badly mangled by years of short-sighted management that they can be used for nothing other than core business functionality, usually with the judicious application of Excel massaging the data before usage. This is how some &lt;em&gt;hospitals&lt;/em&gt; plan bed allocation. There is a 100% chance that people are fucking &lt;em&gt;killed&lt;/em&gt; over this due to a lack of bed space every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 90% of the engineers I meet are totally disempowered and treated like trash by management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most teachers aren't actually very good at teaching, though I don't know what the number is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, when someone I know painstakingly drags themselves out to find a psychologist for whatever reason, they find that most psychologists fucking suck or are total quacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The miracle of modern society is that anything works at all, and that many things &lt;em&gt;even work well&lt;/em&gt;, but it is despite all the dysfunction at regular organizations, not because that dysfunction doesn't exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has nothing to do with "looking down" on things. These are just, as near as I can tell, facts about the world. Like, have you &lt;em&gt;spoken&lt;/em&gt; to a real estate agent or tech recruiter? Almost all of them are absolute fuckers, and the only difference is that it affects you so you can &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; that they're fuckers, whereas a shit-tier manager/engineer/teacher can operate so invisibly at a large organization that no one notices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this just is what it is, and acknowledging it is how you navigate it effectively, and navigating it effectively is how you achieve some level of happiness for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recruiter had coffee with me a few weeks ago because business at their massive agency was down. The agency, goddamn &lt;em&gt;Hays&lt;/em&gt;, was suggesting that the recruiters finally learn things about technology, so this guy who had been working for five years &lt;em&gt;asked me what AWS was&lt;/em&gt;. Things are &lt;em&gt;fucked&lt;/em&gt; at most places, my dude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-why-dont-you-just-make-a-company-then"&gt;IV. Why Don't You Just Make A Company Then?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm in my shed putting spikes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the rims of my car for the upcoming death race&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, you think I &lt;em&gt;won't&lt;/em&gt;? I'm going to &lt;em&gt;tear shit up&lt;/em&gt; within two years, or absolutely fail and then just not mention this again and everyone will just forget about it. So, you know, watch out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For real though, this is also totally missing the point. My point is that the bulk of income from most organizations comes from a tiny handful of sources (and in pathological cases, this can purely be from government protection, such as organizations that can gatekeep visa provisioning), but &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of the organization supporting that is too large to run efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are certainly sad, dark corners of Netflix run by petty tyrants who earn more money than we ever will. It is too large for it not to be the case. So when I do the above, I suspect the only way to avoid becoming what I hate is... just don't become that big. It isn't a problem of people all being so fucking dumb that they can't run a big organization effectively, I suspect it &lt;em&gt;can't be done&lt;/em&gt;. The best you can hope for is to have a strict handle on the parts that generate most of the revenue, then you earn enough money than the various leechlike sub-organizations can't drain your lifeblood fast enough to kill you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And unfortunately, if you want to build something as complicated as a GPU, you probably just have to make the gigantic organization and bite the inefficiency bullet. Them's the breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke to a telecommunications director recently, and I asked how an organization that large manages to keep running so effectively. He exchanged looks with another engineer who worked there (a look which said most of it doesn't run effectively), then elaborated that everything sucks (surprise) &lt;em&gt;unless&lt;/em&gt; you cause a network outage, in which case you are mega-fired and banished to the shadow realm on top of that. That's the bit that makes the revenue, and the rest of it is a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v-my-friend-taking-leave"&gt;V. My Friend Taking Leave&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, my friend got called out for taking leave for a year because he was being irresponsible. He doesn't have a wife and kids, but we now say "What about my children?" every time we leave work, so I guess something good came of this.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/responding-to-primeagen-and-also-society-i-guess/</guid></item><item><title>I Will Fucking Haymaker You If You Mention Agile Again</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-will-fucking-haymaker-you-if-you-mention-agile-again/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;With God as my witness, the next son of a bitch to mention Agile is going to get hurled into the ground so hard that I'm going to publish a seismology paper in Nature with the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i-i-personally-find-stand-ups-very-usefu-"&gt;I. I Personally Find Stand-Ups Very Usefu-&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those apologists who insist that Agile works very well for them - you can leave now with my blessing. Half of you have only worked at functional organizations, and you're best off not knowing how most of the world lives. Your precious, pure minds are possibly the tech world's rarest resource, and they must be protected at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other half of you are absolutely deluded. All of you, you stay. Greg, lock the doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which absolute fucking maniac in this room decided that the most sensible thing to do in a culture where everyone has &lt;em&gt;way too many&lt;/em&gt; meetings was schedule &lt;em&gt;recurring meetings every day&lt;/em&gt;? Don't look away. Do you have no idea how terrible the average person is at running a meeting? Do you? How hard is it to just let people know what they should do and then &lt;em&gt;let them do it&lt;/em&gt;. Do you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; think that, if you hired someone incompetent enough that this isn't an option, that they will ever be able to handle something as complicated as software engineering?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am telling you right now, the average 15-minute stand-up runs for 30-60 minutes, &lt;em&gt;every fucking day&lt;/em&gt;, and absolutely jack shit is accomplished, other than everyone delaying work until the stand-up is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But I really think that my team benefits from -"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I just excused our dear, dear unicorn-minded developers from this event, you must live amongst the rest of us, the unwashed masses that turn up every day to blearily mutter "No blockers" around a mouthful of life-restoring caffeine in the desperate hope that this accursed meeting might end even a minute sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one else finds this meeting useful. Let me repeat that again. &lt;em&gt;No one else finds this meeting useful&lt;/em&gt;. We're either going to do the work or we aren't going to do the work, and in either case, I am going to pile-drive you from the top rope if you keep scheduling these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-its-only-ten-min-"&gt;II. It's Only Ten Min-&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, it overwhelmingly isn't&lt;/em&gt;. And even if it was ten minutes, the average manager is &lt;em&gt;clearly incapable&lt;/em&gt; of running these things in a way that isn't infantilizing, and despite the fact that I am clearly throwing a tantrum, presumably &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the people reading this are adults that won't tolerate &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; amount of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's ignoring all the retros that result in nothing, and grooming the backlog that we'll never clear and &lt;em&gt;Christ&lt;/em&gt;, just stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-but-we-have-to-work-through-the-backlog-"&gt;III. But We Have To Work Through The Backlog-&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What goddamn &lt;em&gt;fantasy land&lt;/em&gt; do you live in and how do I get in? I'm going to explain this very slowly in the desperate hopes that you can understand something that isn't on a Confluence page if it is delivered at a sufficiently glacial pace, and if you demonstrate sufficient comprehension, I will refrain from operating this guillotine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work must go out. Faster than it goes in. Do you understand?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your backlog is getting bigger, then &lt;em&gt;work is going into it faster than it is going out&lt;/em&gt;. Why is that happening? &lt;em&gt;Fuck if I know, but it is probably totally unrelated to not doing Agile well enough&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're agreeing to everything because your stakeholders are whiny children with a deficient understanding of business and no one can say no to them. The team has made so many bad technical decisions that any speed is impossible, and if this is the case, &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-will-fucking-dropkick-you-if-you-use-that-spreadsheet/"&gt;I am willing to bet that you've got some spreadsheets in there&lt;/a&gt;, you absolute animal. Your engineers don't have brains that work good. &lt;em&gt;I don't know, but Agile isn't going to help&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;High Output Management&lt;/em&gt; was the most highly-recommended management book I could find that wasn't an outright textbook. Do you know what it says at the beginning? Probably not, because the kind of person that I am forced to choke out over their love of Agile typically can't read anything that isn't on LinkedIn. It says &lt;em&gt;work must go out faster than it goes in&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;all of these meetings obviously don't do either of those things&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-bu-"&gt;IV. Bu-&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't even know what you're going to say, but let me stop you right there, because what the fuck is up with all of these meetings if we're using Jira or whatever all day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to explain our industry to a non-engineer the other day, and they looked at me like I was &lt;em&gt;crazy&lt;/em&gt;. I didn't even rant, I did it in the polite, unassuming manner that a genteel corporate drone might employ, and they still didn't understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do you have to have the daily meetings if all the details are supposed to be on the cards?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I didn't have an answer for them because there is no answer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know how people do work in other industries? &lt;em&gt;They go do the work and talk to their colleagues if they need to&lt;/em&gt;. The most productive I've ever been was when I just sat down and fixed the problem with smart people when it made sense to do so, and I have never produced anything of value in any other context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v-but-we-need-to-know-how-much-work-will-get-done"&gt;V. But We Need To Know How Much Work Will Get Done!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, fuck off. Go visit Jira right now, look at a burndown chart or something, and you tell me how that's working out for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's some neat intel - I've been attending conferences this year, and whenever I get the chance, I ask people to see what percentage of their estimated workload gets done every sprint. It is &lt;em&gt;always about half&lt;/em&gt;. From banks to hospitals to fintech to whatever, it's half, and I am practically &lt;em&gt;drowning&lt;/em&gt; in stressed-out managers trying to figure out how they can do Agile better. &lt;em&gt;That'll&lt;/em&gt; make the numbers come out better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need stand-ups every other day! The retro format isn't correct! We aren't doing planning poker the right way! We need Agile training!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to uppercut you so hard that I will spend the next two months recovering from the fractures in my hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the problem is one of estimation, then &lt;em&gt;commit to half as much work and see what happens&lt;/em&gt;. If you run out of work to do, you can always throw more things on there. If you haven't even tried this, the most obvious thing on the planet, then &lt;em&gt;you are in a cult and only you can save yourself&lt;/em&gt;. You have outsourced your thinking to people that &lt;em&gt;don't have brains&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're at the point where I can infer ten thousand things about a team's operational capacity by just asking if their manager talks about being more Agile, and they're &lt;em&gt;all bad&lt;/em&gt;. And don't get me wrong, this is like a superpower because it means I can poach your best engineers whenever I want! All I have to do is say "Hey, I'm not going to fuck with you while you're trying to do something fulfilling" and they will &lt;em&gt;beg&lt;/em&gt; me to arrange a role, so by all means, just keep going if that's fine with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vi-what-do-i-do-instead"&gt;VI. What Do I Do Instead?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, the problem is actually totally unrelated to Agile. The problem is really that most of these people are &lt;em&gt;not good at their jobs&lt;/em&gt;. The part of the human mind that is supposed to recognize patterns and make plans has been utterly calcified somehow, and is only capable of repeating the same moves over and over. They would fail to manage with any methodology, and the thing I object to is that they've chosen to fail in a way that inconveniences other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're going to insist on overpromising and otherwise being utterly incompetent, just choose to do it with a method that doesn't involve all the meetings and ceremony. Like, literally just join a more considerate cult and we won't have to do pistols at sunset. This is a &lt;em&gt;very good&lt;/em&gt; offer! You don't even have to start being useful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret is that there's no secret for doing things correctly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to hire the correct people, motivate them to continue working even when there's no clear risk of being fired, make them feel valued and appreciated, &lt;em&gt;not waste their time&lt;/em&gt;, ensure they've got the space to do work the right way, &lt;em&gt;only accept the right work&lt;/em&gt;, and then just leave them the hell alone. If they have brains, they'll figure everything else out themselves. Does that sound really hard? &lt;em&gt;Yeah&lt;/em&gt;, that's why some random engineer can &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/your-organization-probably-doesnt-want-to-improve-things/"&gt;post an unhinged rant about organizations being useless at accomplishing trivial goals&lt;/a&gt; and 100,000 &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; engineers just agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three best managers I've ever worked for, with the most productive teams (at large organizations, so don't even start on the excuses about scale) just let the team work and were there if I needed advice or a discussion, and they afforded me the quiet dignity of &lt;em&gt;not hiring clowns to work alongside me&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have to clutch their hands through the process, you will only be dragging them to the ink-black depths of the icy ocean alongside you when I finally find you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epics and stories also have stupid names.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-will-fucking-haymaker-you-if-you-mention-agile-again/</guid></item><item><title>Managers Can Know They're Being Evil</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/managers-can-know-theyre-being-evil/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It has been remarked that I am far too cynical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I have some evidence to support this position. In particular, I wanted to address the assertion that I'm too harsh on managers as a class. I will concede that I know a handful of &lt;em&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt; managers - the ratio is maybe 1:20? I only want to talk about the most pathological case today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i-micromanagers"&gt;I. Micromanagers&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, there are managers that micromanage everything, and are absolutely toxic personalities. At a guess, this seems to be about half of them. Many are totally pleasant &lt;em&gt;outside of management contexts&lt;/em&gt;, but when they get power, there is some grotesque symbiosis with all their underlying neuroses, and they just absolutely ruin months or years of people's lives. They think their job is to ensure that their worker ants are getting each individual task done on schedule, and this naturally selects for people who have similarly ugly tendencies or who lack the self-confidence to do better for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, for those readers even younger than myself, I would argue that the most &lt;em&gt;important&lt;/em&gt; thing you can select for in life is the quality of the people you spend time with. This means that your partner in a relationship should be open to hard conversations without you feeling unduly anxious, your friends shouldn't be fucking morons gun-slinging drama at high noon every day, and you 100% do not tolerate managers that infantilize or belittle you in any way (unless you desperately need the money).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The net result is that all the mature adults &lt;em&gt;eventually&lt;/em&gt; leave such managers with a few exceptions, leaving only personalities that either can only work with clear direction every few hours (which is sometimes fine), those who treat people like garbage because they haven't learned to identify those behaviours as deleterious, and people whose self-confidence is so low that they can't get work elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, many of these managers &lt;em&gt;aren't&lt;/em&gt; pleasant outside of management contexts. The corporate world naturally selects for some extremely ugly personality traits. I've seen someone on a few million dollars a year bully restaurant staff for &lt;em&gt;one free dish at a restaurant&lt;/em&gt; and shush a child at the table that pointed it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-is-it-deliberate"&gt;II. Is It Deliberate?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may have noted the above case before as strong evidence that at least &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; people do not behave badly because of some deliberate strategy. They've just gotten stuck at some very low level of social maturity, and will simply throw their toys out of the pram at any sign of resistance in any social setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend asked me how they succeed yesterday, and I said &lt;em&gt;I let them&lt;/em&gt;. These people are fucking &lt;em&gt;nuts&lt;/em&gt;. When I realize I'm talking to one of them, I just let them have whatever they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slightest sign of resistance is going to cause them to undermine me at &lt;em&gt;every opportunity&lt;/em&gt; that is available to them for the remainder of their stay with the organization. I could possibly fight back by virtue of not being (as much of) a dickhead, but that would be incredibly tiring and save the organization money, not me. Or I could lose and get annihilated, which I've seen before at more than one organization. Or just... let them have whatever, it's the company's money, not mine, and they &lt;em&gt;chose to hire this sicko&lt;/em&gt;. I'm not the corporate police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But with that said&lt;/em&gt;... there are a surprising number of managers that know &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what they're doing. Some people are just smart and connect the dots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I was approached by a director, who we will call Owen, at work, who didn't quite recognize me. You see, I'd worked at this organization before in a different, distant team. &lt;em&gt;However&lt;/em&gt;, now I worked in a non-management capacity for the man that Owen currently hated, Steve, because Steve was asking hard questions about a failing project and it was highlighting Owen's blistering incompetence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owen sidled up to me and someone else, and started venting a little bit. Truth be told, I felt a bit bad for him. I'd always known he was a grifter, and not a particularly good one, but he seemed harmless. Plus, most projects here failed anyway, so it's not like he was drastically altering outcomes for the negative. If not Owen failing, then someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he said two things that totally changed my mind about him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, he joked about being extremely excited to start managing a new platform next year, because "no one cares about it - you can just do anything and never get in trouble". It &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; funny, because he was absolutely correct that I could literally just do nothing for years and never be caught on that platform if I was in his position, but it also indicated an awareness that he knew &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what he was doing. Here was a director, who had the pressure of being a bullshit artist simply hit critical mass, and he just &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to vent to the nearest person that openly had a sense of humor in the office. He was 100% aware of the dynamics at play at the organization, and that cast his behavior into a totally new light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, he quietly started dropping hints that the director I work for was "getting defensive", not realizing that I worked for his archnemesis. He was very transparently trying to kick off the old rumor mill after deciding I was friendly. Again, that son of a bitch knows &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what he's doing, within his own limited capacities. Imagine how dangerous someone actually smart would be in that position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, a lot of managers behave exactly like this guy. That's in my personal experience, which I think some readers will resonate with. But for others, more dubious, I recommend the book &lt;em&gt;Moral Mazes: The World of Corporate Managers&lt;/em&gt; by Robert Jackall, which reveals that a lot of these people are pretty savvy in political matters, if not management matters, once again revealing that management is really not the main goal of managers in dysfunctional settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple litmus test for the truth of his book is whether your organization restructures when you get a new member of the C-suite in charge? If the answer is yes, then all that stuff is probably happening, either in the open or from a position you can't see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii"&gt;III.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which leads me to my main point, which is the wonder of a man literally  named "Jackal" deciding to investigate a pack of corporate managers.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/managers-can-know-theyre-being-evil/</guid></item><item><title>I Am Filled With Livid Animals</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-am-filled-with-livid-animals/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;There is a terrible fight going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i"&gt;I.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the terrible fight between a wolf that wants to do something halfway productive, and a lazy wolf that wants to chill out because his organization seems to only care about making dashboards no one reads, but they still provide that wolf as much meat as he wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which one will win? The one that says "great idea, boss" the most frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii"&gt;II.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a third fucking wolf now, and it is trying to distract both the other wolves by insisting that meaningful change is possible, but &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; if all change is added to a Jira backlog and carefully scoped out. The first wolf is pointing out that the backlog is growing in size, which means all cards with a priority lower than 'urgent' will necessarily never get worked on because what we have here is a good old-fashioned wolf bottleneck, and the third wolf is agreeing but insisting on doing the same thing they've always done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second wolf has his camera off, so I can only hope he's listening instead of watching YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii"&gt;III.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Christ, where are all these wolves coming from? A fourth beast has entered the fray, frothing at the mouth, insisting that wolves #1 and #3 should consult it before making changes to the codebase. The codebase seems to consist entirely of a mixture of scarcely comprehensible Python and ChatGPT tests that don't quite work. All of the obscure lines technically &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; something, but they solve undocumented problems that the fourth wolf introduced by being a fucking wolf, and wolves can't code for shit. The fourth wolf has unlimited job security because of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second wolf is enjoying Star Trek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv"&gt;IV.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuck me, with God as my witness, as soon as Wolf #1 suggested we get some working tests into critical portions of the codebase, a fifth wolf joined the call to say that we can't start writing tests without a roadmap, because we can't do anything without a roadmap even though the roadmaps have never progressed even &lt;em&gt;roughly&lt;/em&gt; on time in the entire history of this department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first wolf is infuriated, the third wolf doesn't understand what a test is, the fourth wolf couldn't write one to save its canine life, and I don't even &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; what the fifth wolf is talking about now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second wolf said 'brb' thirty minutes ago, and has not bothered to rejoin the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v"&gt;V.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most senior wolf has joined, and has noted that while all of these issues are pressing, we simply have too much to deliver because of various wolf packs over-committing on projects that have &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; pack as a critical dependency. We will get to all these improvements as soon as we've cleared those at the end of this quarter, which is what this wolf has said every quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't even know where the second wolf has gone. He was muted during standup this morning and just didn't say anything about his cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v_1"&gt;V.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am filled by an entire department of wolves, and they have collectively decided that organizational change is possible, but it will first require a careful shift of culture and demonstration of best practice. This will take several years, realistically, and while none of these wolves has ever seen it happen successfully, they all agree that this absolves them of any performance issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second wolf has been offered an incredibly lucrative job at an external organization, roughly doubling his salary, because he was having coffee and playing board games with smarter/richer wolves, and learning how to actually get shit done. This is despite only deploying about 50 lines of code this entire year, mostly because this one year old platform somehow already has so much technical debt that anything faster is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vi"&gt;VI.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am the second wolf, what the goddamn hell is going on with this industry?&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-am-filled-with-livid-animals/</guid></item><item><title>Take Care Of Yourself And Touch Grass</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/take-care-of-yourself-and-touch-grass/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/your-organization-probably-doesnt-want-to-improve-things/"&gt;Yesterday's post&lt;/a&gt; received a lot more attention than the regular ones do. There are plenty of things to talk about, ranging from my favourite comments (people telling me I'm right), the most useful comments (pointing out flaws in my thinking), and the funniest comments (&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/172ulqr/your_organization_probably_doesnt_want_to_improve/"&gt;Reddit fucking hates me and I think I love it&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing I wanted to talk about immediately is the outpouring of individuals who either sounded like they were despairing about their work situation, or who were worried that perceiving things the way I do, I would argue 'realistically', is toxic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who found my writing cathartic &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; depressing, here are some thoughts on what to do if you are blessed/cursed with a functioning intellect that thinks LinkedIn is full of absolute motherfuckers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i-some-places-dont-suck"&gt;I. Some Places Don't Suck&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I have not been working for that long personally, particularly compared to some of my blog readers who have worked for &lt;em&gt;decades&lt;/em&gt;, I think I'm at least reasonably perceptive. More importantly, I don't waste a lot of time perceiving anything that isn't extremely obvious - I just find perceptive people who are much older and ask them what's up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, thanks to this blog, I suspect that I am able to channel the scar tissue of enough engineers to blot out the sun via my inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those that are worried good workplaces do not exist, I don't know what constitutes good, but &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; definitely exists. To quote a friend, working as a private sector director, every large organization has enough problems for them to feel gross at times, but the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; place he has ever worked was a hundred times worse compared to the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your workplace is truly miserable, it is extremely likely that you can find something better. I'm a young, non-white immigrant with a foreign-sounding name that is only smart enough to program in Python and no network when I moved here. If you are bad at finding work, I will &lt;em&gt;tell you how to do it&lt;/em&gt;. It does not involve sending CVs anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-touch-grass"&gt;II. Touch Grass&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever anyone points out that organizations are frequently stupid, there is a type of person that says "Oh yeah, smart guy? Why don't you just &lt;em&gt;fix&lt;/em&gt; something instead of complaining?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given what I normally write about, I feel like this demonstrates terrible  reading comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; type of person that despairs after listening to the person above. "What's the point in trying? Fixing things doesn't work!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you are taking steps to improve your working situation, it's good to think about whether you're wasting energy. I will &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; tell someone to give up on doing self-work and improving their happiness. What I'm trying to say frequently is to &lt;em&gt;carefully look at whether the system you are engaging with wants to change&lt;/em&gt;, and if it does not, &lt;em&gt;don't waste energy&lt;/em&gt;. I am making the hard soul read now that most of the readers here are probably &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; invested in companies that won't love them back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way people talk about "checking out", you'd think they &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; care about data pipelines more than like, sunlight and music. The most valuable pieces of advice I got from my first mentor/manager was that I should work out more to protect my back and learn how to make desserts from scratch for dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-work-less"&gt;III. Work Less&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the stupid things about technology, salaries in the field are extremely high for very little work (especially if you've talked to a nurse). This is the advice that always provokes the most gnashing of teeth, but if you are young and technically talented, you can just optimize for money and then work less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've mentioned elsewhere that I work three days a week now. I earn the same amount I did three years ago despite that. Hey everyone, it turns out that companies &lt;em&gt;really are&lt;/em&gt; fucking gross and I'm happier now. All the people that were like "The grass is greener, it won't really change anything?". &lt;em&gt;So wrong&lt;/em&gt;. I still have days where cartoon plumes of smoke shoot from my ears like a goddamn train, but then I go for a music lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in America. I'm just like, some guy on pretty average tech money in a first world country. If you have the programming sense to enjoy my &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-will-fucking-dropkick-you-if-you-use-that-spreadsheet/"&gt;spreadsheet rant&lt;/a&gt; then it is extremely likely there is a three-day-a-week arrangement on good money available to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; finished negotiations with another company, well-known enough that some of my readers recognize the name for the first time in my life, and there is a 20%-ish chance they'll give me three days a week, so I'm quite confident my strategy is replicable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-gratitude"&gt;IV. Gratitude&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are tons of things to be ungrateful for (it's one of my favourite hobbies), but I had lunch with a recruiter recently. That was extremely funny for various reasons, but that's for another post. The &lt;em&gt;important&lt;/em&gt; thing is that he mentioned he used to be a plumber before he was a recruiter, and it was killing him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As a programmer, many of the people I know feel like they don't have &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; jobs and spend too much time in front of computers."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I used to wake up at 5AM to dig holes in the mud. If you ever thing about leaving tech for plumbing, come talk to me first."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may be in spreadsheet hell, but I also had time to hit the gym before clocking in, and am not knee-deep in mud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v-on-risk"&gt;V. On Risk&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people tell me that they &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; afford to take a risk, and this is why I've largely not addressed what I do &lt;em&gt;instead&lt;/em&gt; of trying to work even harder. I am young with no dependents, and frankly I am frequently extremely stupid. I'd have no right to tell someone with kids, or who didn't have the luxury of moving to the first-world, that they should take risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I do want to share two stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is I had a friend who wasn't in tech at all, who has slowly going insane in a toxic workplace. We studied programming together for about three months, and he extremely rapidly (with a hefty dose of exaggerating his experience) landed an incredible job, supporting his two children and wife who was studying, then got &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; raise within six months. He's now earning more than he ever has, in more comfort than he has ever had. It felt like a huge risk at the time, but sometimes it pays off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have any stories from people that regretted the risks they took around work, but I tried very hard to think of one. That doesn't mean they aren't there, just that they're either infrequent &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; those people got fucking owned so hard that they've been survivorship-biased out of existence. Have fun figuring out which one it is, because I still haven't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second story is really two stories, that are wildly different but also the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I moved to my new home country, I had a cousin who had just finished medical school. There were involved in a fatal car crash before they could start practicing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I had another classmate in a class when I was nearing my final year of university. I invited him to stay with my family back home for a trip he had planned, but when I came to class next week, it turned out he had died in an accident while trying to save another victim's life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I'm saying is that life comes at you fast sometimes, and there's a real cost to being miserable too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our mortality made salient, the only wisdom I can offer that I am 100% confident in is...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vi-to-achieve-happiness"&gt;VI. To Achieve Happiness...&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't use spreadsheets, you absolute sons of bitches. You dogs. You curs. You scoundrels. I will throw you off a cliff, and at the bottom of that cliff will be Agile consultants.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/take-care-of-yourself-and-touch-grass/</guid></item><item><title>Your Organization Probably Doesn't Want To Improve Things</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/your-organization-probably-doesnt-want-to-improve-things/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I had a fascinating conversation with a reader around frustration and unhappiness at work. Much of it was totally obvious to both of us, but it occurred to me that this probably &lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; to everyone, which is why almost all of my colleagues (in very cushy, non-stressful jobs) nonetheless need therapy. And if it isn't obvious to everyone, it's worth writing about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now believe that this stems from a failure to recognize the gap, frequently vast, between what is being &lt;em&gt;said&lt;/em&gt; by a person and what is being felt, and how this discrepancy applies to organizations too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was sparked by reference to a concept called the &lt;em&gt;honne-tatemae&lt;/em&gt; divide, which are Japanese concepts related to the true feelings of an individual and the front they present in public. I don't actually know anything about the Japanese context beyond this one Wikipedia article, so this has been dropped entirely so that I seem worldly and to give us vocabulary less onerous than "what you really think" and "what you're forced to say".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i-tatemae"&gt;I. Tatemae&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never met a single manager at any large company that has not said they want to be &lt;em&gt;data driven&lt;/em&gt;. I have also never seen a single one of them take any steps that could actually move them in this direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the average annual salary for a Power BI developer places them in the 90th percentile of my country's annual income. For those of you unfamiliar with Power BI, you connect it to data sources and then it makes visualizations for managers to gawk at, and it is so simple to use that it is not inconceivable to me that you could &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; train a monkey to make a bar chart with the correct application of positive reinforcement and peanuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a handful of people who do amazing things in Power BI, but the hard truth is that most people who work in it are &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; just dragging-and-dropping bar charts onto a page after connecting it to a spreadsheet, being paid absolutely exorbitantly, and then if they're smart, going home and despairing. This is because Power BI tracks usage metrics and almost all dashboards are completely unused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current organization has 8000 staff members, and I used to glance over the usage metrics of the dashboards my old team produced. I believe three dashboards were used, out of somewhere around 50 - 100. Of those being visited, it usually turned out they were being visited by members of our team checking to see if the data had refreshed for the day. I'd estimate the cost of maintaining our team was approximately $1,000,000 for an organization that supposedly can't afford to waste that money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management has no choice but to say that they want to be data driven. It's not like they can just come out and &lt;em&gt;say&lt;/em&gt; that it's all fucked - so they say the only thing that is available. We are going through a "digital transformation", and that is why all of these efforts don't generate any revenue and drive staff to misery. It will be better once this current initiative successfully completes, even though we have never demonstrated the ability to successfully complete a similar initiative at any point in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-honne"&gt;II. Honne&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two pressures that drive the garbled stream of corporate of nonsense at organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="i-sturgeons-law"&gt;I. Sturgeon's Law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; simple, and I sometimes lose sight of it while I'm deep in the theory mines of incentives and other smarter takes. 90% of everything is crud, and that explains almost everything. Most managers have never had an independent thought on how to manage people effectively (hence the Agile parroting), most programmers don't know what an abstraction is, etc, etc. This is the &lt;em&gt;overwhelming&lt;/em&gt; factor even though it isn't a satisfying answer, but it has done more for my own peace of mind than anything that follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to be pretty good on the fencing circuit - as in, olympic fencing, with the swords. It never occurred to me &lt;em&gt;for even a goddamn second&lt;/em&gt; that we could win competitions without having good, smart people that understood the sport and trained hard. If we lose because Derek didn't turn up to practice for six months, I might be pissed off and upset, but I am not &lt;em&gt;spiritually confused&lt;/em&gt; about why my efforts aren't rewarding me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what possesses us to turn up at work and think that we can accomplish anything with fucking Derek over there calling the shots while slamming their empty head onto a keyboard as rapidly as Jira will allow him to create cards we won't finish, but for some reason it's a thing that happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derek will repeat whatever brain-dead thing is in vogue but they are &lt;em&gt;very stupid&lt;/em&gt; and will repeat literally anything that sounds popular, plus will never question that they have never had an unambiguous success over their entire career. This means they will inevitably become promoted over time, because unlike the rest of us who have to put in &lt;em&gt;effort&lt;/em&gt; and pay what a friend of mine terms &lt;em&gt;soul cost&lt;/em&gt; to act like a sycophant, they believe it sincerely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ii-sturgeons-law-again"&gt;II. Sturgeon's Law Again&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the pressure if you're in the 10% of people that aren't crud at their jobs - you're surrounded by people that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; crud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong - I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; that terrible person at many things. There are fencing teams where I'd be absolute dead weight. My piano playing leaves much to be desired. Last week, I managed to stub the little toe on both feet, on the same day, on two separate occasions, and I have on at least one occasion absentmindedly dropped a teaspoon into the trash instead of a tea bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However I don't do any of that professionally. In professional settings, approximately &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of my time goes into solving problems introduced by people that are just indescribably bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work on a platform that cost my organization an eye-watering sum of money to produce, over the span of two years, and the engineers responsible for it elected to use spreadsheets to control the infrastructure, so we now have a spreadsheet with 400 separate worksheets that powers but one part of this whole shambling mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine the kind of havoc such people could wreak upon infrastructure and code if left unchecked?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; chance a team with people like that is going to produce good results? Obviously not. Do most teams at large organizations have at least one person like that? Sweet merciful Christ, in both my first, second, and perhaps even third-hand experience, whatever that means, it's possible that &lt;em&gt;half of all teams consist entirely of that person&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can my manager keep their job if they honestly say "There is no chance this team will ever hit its objectives"? &lt;em&gt;Fuck&lt;/em&gt; no, if they did that they'd be &lt;em&gt;gone&lt;/em&gt;, so the system is constantly selecting for people that are either too dumb to realize it's hopeless, too perversely incentivized to be honest, or too deep into despair to &lt;em&gt;admit to themselves&lt;/em&gt; it is hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-ignoring-is-bliss"&gt;III. Ignoring Is Bliss&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Tao of Programming:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novice asked the Master: "In the East, there is a great tree-structure that men call 'Corporate Headquarters'. It is bloated out of shape with vice presidents and accountants. It issues a multitude of memos, each saying 'Go Hence!' or 'Go Hither!' and nobody knows what is meant. Every year new names are put onto the branches, but all to no avail. How can such an unnatural entity exist?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Master replied: "You perceive this immense structure and are disturbed that it has no rational purpose. Can you not take amusement from its endless gyrations? Do you not enjoy the untroubled ease of programming beneath its sheltering branches? Why are you bothered by its uselessness?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quote the above because it is very funny, and because the only thing that has brought me clarity is totally ignoring anything management says unless I have a very good reason to believe the person I am speaking to has intelligence, integrity, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; has come to terms with the fact that large organizations are inherently dysfunctional, which happens rarely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a friend that was denied a raise after working at a company diligently for five years - there was no budget, he was told. He was upset, and ended up spending a year traveling the world on sabbatical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While he was away, a new position opened up in the same department, for the same job title - it was a permanent role, theoretically exactly the same job he was doing in an identical team with the same managers. They gave me that job, all the money he asked for, plus another hefty sum on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management saying there was no budget &lt;em&gt;meant nothing&lt;/em&gt; - it is purely a thing they are forced to say, and if the person saying it was not particularly insightful, they even believed it. The &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; thing an organization can do that means &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; is actually solving your problem, and &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; words to the effect of "we'll address your concerns soon" or "we just need to do some planning around this", etc, should just be ignored wholesale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, I ignore everything they've said about salary (I just state a number and don't budge, and they usually just give me what I want despite saying it was impossible), I ignore everything they say around work culture and the teams they want to build (I don't factor it into my decisions around whether it's a team I'd like to join because I know it isn't trustworthy), and frankly, sometimes I just ignore them because fuck 'em, why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I let them talk as much as they want about work culture or whatever. These are the endless gyrations of the great tree structure, rustling in the wind. Actually &lt;em&gt;remove&lt;/em&gt; the staff that no one wants to work with or who terrorize their subordinates and I'll know you're serious about performance. Reward people for staying, and I'll know you're serious about valuing people. Anything short of that is less than worthless, because you've wasted valuable time I could have been listening to music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's much more peaceful to solve a few problems, not waste a single iota of my energy on creating systemic change unless we're going to try curing cancer, then log off to touch grass. Realizing that no mere &lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt; can demonstrate an appetite for true change was necessary for me to make that change in my life - hopefully it does the same for someone else.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/your-organization-probably-doesnt-want-to-improve-things/</guid></item><item><title>Reverence for the Craft, Business, and Your Immortal Soul</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/reverence-for-the-craft-business-and-your-immortal-soul/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I have fortnightly piano lessons with an extremely young teacher - yes, I left Asia only to become more Asian than I ever was back home. At a guess, I would say he's about 21 years old - very cool. Long hair, a very laid back manner of speech, and always ready with some fascinating detail about whatever piece we're working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my &lt;em&gt;God&lt;/em&gt; the dude shreds! I'll be asking for advice on beginner-level improv, and he'll say something to the effect of "Well, start by really learning your scales even if they're dull... then you can do something like -" and will proceed to absolutely rock the fuck out for a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely effortless, and with such immense passion and focus for what is being done at that exact moment. It got me thinking about reverence for your craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i"&gt;I.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On any given day at work, I'm doing one of two things - I'm drinking tea, which is spiritually good even though the office provides terrible tea, and participating in uploading data to a warehouse from utterly soulless third-party enterprise systems, which is spiritually not good, because it turns out even &lt;em&gt;proximity&lt;/em&gt; to things that aren't cared for is corossive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I mean? Well, I used to work personally with one of these soulless sytems, that we had purchased at great expense, to handle some critical business details. The implementation details of this software were awful. The data model was lunacy, all the fields were the wrong types, the table names were all things like 'ABV_FGV_774', the field names were chock-full of abbreviations, our internal staff had resorted to just typing data into unrelated fields that were seldom used to save on asking for modifications, and the vendor charged a prohibitive amount of money to make improvements. I am likely not describing anything new to any readers in technology, but for those not in technology, this is a bit like renting out a car for $100,000 that needs to be pushed into a running start by twelve burly gym-goers, and changing a tire is going to run you up $20,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought the problem was that working with the thing was frustrating because... well, look at it. It sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years later and with a little bit more wisdom under my belt, yes, it was frustrating for that reason. But frustration isn't always a &lt;em&gt;problem&lt;/em&gt;. I learned to code. That's basically just blasting through six months of frustration because you're too dumb to read a stack trace carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, the issue is that it was obvious no one cared about the quality of this thing. In fact, let's say that again with the capital it deserves. No one cared about the Quality of this thing. It was the &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; opposite of how my piano teacher approaches his playing. When you work day in and day out with something where Quality isn't important, you take psychic damage. When you work with people that don't at least share a vision of Quality, then you struggle to have happy relationships with them. When you have to compromise on Quality in favor of money, the soul cries out and you draw the borders of yourself away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, and this is a sad statement, but this seems to be the very nature of working for most businesses. The reality is that there are considerations other than the pure pursuit of Quality and patient work. The business must earn money, there are people you must avoid pissing off because while they do not produce Quality, they may also be peers or seniors, and also sometimes you don't have enough left in the tank to insist on Quality. Also, more frequently, someone wants to get promoted so we're doing the thing they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have, this very year, approved some bad code because I was worn down on that particular day, and wasn't looking forward to &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; argument because I'm like one of two people that ever rejects code. Guilty, guilty, guilty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it seems inevitable, but also, &lt;em&gt;fuck that&lt;/em&gt;. Upon reflection, there isn't a quantity of money large enough to make me ditch the pursuit of Quality in the largest domains of my life. I turned down a job that would have &lt;em&gt;doubled&lt;/em&gt; my salary last week because the person talking to me gave me slightly off vibes. Again, I am &lt;em&gt;not a reasonable person&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii"&gt;II.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is Quality? Let's not waste too much time on that. You know what it is.  It's a vague constellation of things, that I and most of the people I consider 'good' will agree on. It doesn't mean complex and it doesn't mean simple, but it's frequently simple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe it's worth talking about what it's not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, it's not synonymous with something that brings you grand meaning in life, though it helps. At this point, I've spoken to so many more experienced people that I am extremely confident in one fact - you can't find major meaning in life at work &lt;em&gt;if you work for someone else&lt;/em&gt;. That's okay. In many ways it's easier than self-employment, and you get lots of time to find the meaning elsewhere. And if you don't get enough time, get paid more and work less. This is left as an exercise for the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it's not something you can unilaterally enforce at work because &lt;em&gt;it isn't visible to many other people&lt;/em&gt;. If they don't have aesthetic sense and if they can't program (or do whatever your craft is), then that's it. This is why it's absolutely disastrous to have managers with no technical knowledge running any sort of team that relies on it. They will be able to pick up superficial quality - tickets cleared, sprint velocity, and how big the buzzwords you use are. They will completely miss out on Capital Q Quality, which might be how carefully crafted the code is, how gently you treat a co-worker, and how big the buzzwords you use ironically are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord forgive me, I am done with management that can't see Quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, Quality isn't always good for the business. Sometimes you have to ship garbage now, and that's just how it is. If customers choose to buy something bad because something good is too expensive, well, the business may adapt and go uphill financially, but it will go downhill spiritually - but the other choice was bankruptcy, so that's that. But honestly, at this point, just move to something Quality again. No being reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, Quality isn't &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt;. Detecting Quality requires mastery, and mastery is like, really fucking boring sometimes. It's just important to realize that boredom isn't going to kill you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to be a pretty good fencer. I competed a bit at the inter-university level, led a team once inter-state, and have occasionally beaten some pretty talented people. Do you know how fencers start to get good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You just drill footwork &lt;em&gt;relentlessly&lt;/em&gt;. In fact, my coach was relatively lax in this regard by modern standards, and &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; felt like a lot of footwork. I probably spent three hours a week, out of a total of nine spent fencing, getting hit and hearing a livid Polish man say "You are allowed to step back!". Once you're done with the footwork, you get promoted to "You are allowed to parry!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I'm learning the piano, and before I get to have fun, I have a million years of catching up to do because half the maniacs I'm trying to catch up with were forced to practice from age 10 to 16. So guess what? It's pretty basic songs and trying to flash-burn Anki cards onto my cortex so that I can read sheet music with the tools that an adult has the discipline to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know what? Even in the technology space, I've just crunched through like 450 pages of reading material, some of it relatively technical, because I'm hoping that the ability to see better Quality will let me work at places that &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; higher Quality. I've finally learned a Lisp and basic data structures (what are the universities teaching kids these days!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quote a reader:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a rare thing, and it’s mostly worthless from a “career” standpoint: in corporateland, it doesn’t matter if you’re best or serviceable. It doesn’t matter if you’re a great accountant or an accountant.  As long as the books are done, no one cares. Doesn’t meant you shouldn’t strive to be the best accountant, but you gotta live with the reality that being great at something is mainly for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know one person whose love of Quality in a very boring field doubled his salary, but I wouldn't &lt;em&gt;count on it&lt;/em&gt;, because my brilliant piano teacher is also forced to teach me (though he enjoys it, I hope!) because I work in I.T at 1/10th his skill level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that study is mainly for me. But I keep the piano going on the side, because I, not management, have to take responsibility for the maintenance of my soul (and the same goes for you too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii"&gt;III.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of this, including the capital Q, was inspired by a reading of &lt;em&gt;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&lt;/em&gt; this year. I picked it up when I was 18, fully 11 years ago now, and pronounced it as absolutely insane garbage. Now I think it's still a bit insane (which, given the subject matter, is not entirely unexpected) but certainly not garbage. Here's a relevant passage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What I wanted to say," I finally get in, "is that I've a set of instructions at home which open up great realms for the improvement of technical writing. They begin, 'Assembly of Japanese bicycle require great peace of mind.’ " &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This produces more laughter, but Sylvia and Gennie and the sculptor give sharp looks of recognition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That’s a good instruction," the sculptor says. Gennie nods too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That’s kind of why I saved it," I say. "At first I laughed because of memories of bicycles I'd put together and, of course, the unintended slur on Japanese manufacture. But there's a lot of wisdom in that statement." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John looks at me apprehensively. I look at him with equal apprehension. We both laugh. He says, "The professor will now expound."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Peace of mind isn't at all superficial, really," I expound. "It’s the whole thing. That which produces it is good maintenance; that which disturbs it is poor maintenance. What we call workability of the machine is just an objectification of this peace of mind. The ultimate test’s always your own serenity. If you don't have this when you start and maintain it while you're working you're likely to build your personal problems right into the machine itself." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They just look at me, thinking about this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's an unconventional concept," I say, "but conventional reason bears it out. The material object of observation, the bicycle or rotisserie, can’t be right or wrong. Molecules are molecules. They don't have any ethical codes to follow except those people give them. The test of the machine is the satisfaction it gives you. There isn’t any other test. If the machine produces tranquillity it’s right. If  it disturbs you it’s wrong until either the machine or your mind is changed. The test of the machine’s always your own mind. There  isn't any other test." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeWeese asks, "What if the machine is wrong and I feel peaceful about it?" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laughter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reply, "That's self-contradictory. If you really don't care you aren't going to know it’s wrong. The thought’ll never occur to you. The act of pronouncing it wrong's a form of caring."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would argue that assembly of piano piece, database, fencing bout, management, blog, and possibly life, requires great piece of mind. &lt;em&gt;Definitely&lt;/em&gt; Japanese bicycle. Time uninterrupted by meetings, an amount of pressure that isn't constantly distracting you while you work, and whatever you need to attend to the building or maintenance in &lt;em&gt;peace&lt;/em&gt; and quiet. You have to be able to work slowly and patiently, and to whatever standard your soul is happy with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know the progression of angry fencing coach admonishments above? You start with "You are allowed to step back!", move on to "You are allowed to parry!", and then, and &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; then, do you graduate to the highest-tier of advice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Move faster - but slowly!"&lt;/p&gt;

Props to &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34955585"&gt;this guy&lt;/a&gt; for the soul read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just some reflections on life so far, and what I'd like to focus on in the future. A major theme of my past year has been on existential issues around work, and I think that going forward, I'll be writing more about other things... but then again, maybe not. I'm a free spirit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; In summary, local man realizes that earning grotesque amounts of money early in his career, combined with extensive networking, have given him the leverage to actually focus on fun things for a while. Direct hatemail to ludicity.hackernews@gmail.com and save yourself the trouble of reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="i"&gt;I.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's 7 AM in the morning on a winter day, with gray skies screened away by my living room curtains, the gradual drip of water occasionally punctuated by the forlorn cries of a bird whose identity I've never worked out in the long years of being here. Day 1 of 365 on the march to finally hitting 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn't get any more sleep despite a late night. It seemed like the time for reflection, so here I am, reflecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never been someone to take my own birthday particularly seriously. A fun fact: at the dinner I set up yesterday, I forgot to book a seat for myself. The birthday muscles have atrophied badly. However, someone referred to yesterday as "the last celebration of my 20s", and that was enough to shift me into the contemplative mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ii"&gt;II.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To work from the past forward, or from the present backwards? The natural order to reflect in seems like it would be from my childhood, drawing clear lines of causality from events to the present, until I'm left with an obvious narrative as to where I am now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I got into statistics and I.T by reading Taleb, leaving me with a natural distrust of narratives. So we're going to do two things differently. Firstly, we're going to start from the future, going backwards, and the other thing I'll mention later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In five years, if all goes well, I'm supposed to be running a small software consultancy with my closest friends &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; to be a licensed clinical psychologist. I would be 34. My attention is drawn immediately to two things. One, that both does major events start with the good ol' &lt;em&gt;if all goes well&lt;/em&gt;. If all goes well, I'd run my own business and have an extremely prestigious clinical qualification, and if my grandmother had wheels then she'd be a bicycle. It's chaos all the way through, and life is driven entirely by that chaos, punctuated by brief periods of predictability where I might successfully make a few cups of tea. Whatever I accomplish during these moments where my model of the world holds up is generally washed away like ants before a storm in the face of the world... just being the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd normally illustrate this point at great length, but these days we have recourse to waving our hands resignedly at the years 2020 - 2022 and shrugging helplessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have concrete plans for the future, and the main thing I've learned in 29 years is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to make predictions, especially about the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="iii"&gt;III.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second thing that I notice about that future is that they're all career goals. When I started working part-time after some real existential crisis, my thinking was that this wasn't sustainable forever. Not because it literally wasn't sustainable - I can easily live off this money for a long time to come. No, it was unsustainable because I was thinking of how many life goals I'd be implicitly giving up on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A house? Forget about it, I don't save enough to pace the prices now that I'm part-time. I was extremely lucky to be one of the few young people that actually was easily on track to afford a place in this particular city. So part-time means that a house is off the table for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More money and status? I'm a senior engineer in my field, despite having only worked for three months as a junior and barely understanding fundamental data engineering. I'm not sure how fulfilling it would be to climb a ladder that is so obviously broken - &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; is smart enough to go through that progression honestly. The industry just has no idea how to hire. Or, to quote Patrick McKenzie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The tech industry is fundamentally unserious about how it recruits, hires, and retains candidates. "&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is certainly instrumentally useful, but status-craving is a poison pill for the spirit. And without a &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; for the money... well, it isn't a great buy at all, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; at the cost of my very limited youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After thinking carefully, the house can wait, I have enough money for now, and I think more status would be bad for me. I've also learned that I'm the type of person that can't handle five days of soulless screen-staring in an office, so I'd have to purchase all of the above at great expense until I work some things out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grew up in Asia. You've just witnessed some &lt;em&gt;crazy&lt;/em&gt; self-actualization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="iv"&gt;IV.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A last little section on career before we move on. I've reflected on the negative, but some things that I've enjoyed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I love motivating other engineers to push their limits and make a good living for themselves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a deep love for teaching, and I've been doing a lot of study lately, because it turns out it's way easier to teach other engineers when you're very talented&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The face time I've gotten with some older people around the office has been great. There really isn't a substitute for life experience, and the hard thing as a young person is realizing you're &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; still going to blunder through all your mistakes the hard way. David Whyte warns that when a friend asks if they should &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; date someone that's bad for them, it's already too late and they're going to do it. In the same way, I think young people are destined to make a lot of the same mistakes even with plenty of warning up front, and the best we can do is do is get it over with &lt;em&gt;quickly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can bail friends out of trouble when they need money, which is pretty wonderful when you think about it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've helped some friends leave horrifying careers by cross-training into technology. Yes, there are many issues with the tech industry, but there are plenty of worse places to be&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, I've been absolutely &lt;em&gt;crunching&lt;/em&gt; through some technical reading, with the goal of having extreme leverage to find something fulfilling when I decide I'm done being part-time. And hey, it turns out actually being good at tech instead of cruising feels great. Weirdly enough, I don't think it comes with more money, but I think it does come with more happiness. To quote a reader:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You gotta live with the reality that being great at something is mainly for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="v"&gt;V.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting career aside, what would I actually like to focus on? Well, I've mentioned I'm part-time, with a solid contract that will last me until 2026 if I choose to exercise the whole thing. The last time I wrote, I was kicking off a tech company with friends. Fortunately, or unfortunately, they've fallen into very well-paid roles, and I think that stuff is going to be on hold for a while as people buy houses and secure incomes for their families. Then again, who knows?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been spending a fair amount of time in music classes, which have been an extremely pleasant way to while away the time, despite my profound lack of natural ability. I highly recommend this for adults, especially if you missed out as a kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around March 2021, I finally learned how to draw, after years of being terrible at it. I'll share some pictures in the future, but it really only took a few hours to go from &lt;em&gt;absolutely terrible&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;hey, not bad&lt;/em&gt;. I'd like to do lots more of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've started attending a weekly improv class, where I've made many close friends. If I recommend music classes, then improv is mandatory. It's a wonderful exploration of social dynamics, psychology, and vulnerability, which I plan to write about soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been running a game of Pathfinder 2e (a Dungeons and Dragons competitor, in case there was any doubt about how nerdy I am) with some of my closest friends for the last year and a half, and I've finally found I've got enough free time to enjoy it instead of feeling like I'm burning precious non-office hours. I take this seriously enough that I'd like to write my own competitor in the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My older friends have also told me this is a great time to really get some strength training and serious cardio in, because I won't enjoy my forties if I don't get started now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lastly, I can honestly say that I've deeply enjoyed talking to everyone that I've met over this blog. I had my first video call with a reader this week, and I've got another one scheduled for tomorrow. Writing honestly has been one of the best things that I've ever done for various reasons. You always hear that hell is other people, but hey, those connections are what make life worth living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It probably isn't great for my &lt;em&gt;career&lt;/em&gt;, especially as I've been pretty honest about how I see industry, but as someone told me recently, "I could have earned more money, but I have to be myself".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty seven years, twenty seven years old&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only thing I know, the only thing I get told&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gotta sell out if I want to get sold&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't want the devil to be taking my soul&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write songs that come from the heart&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't give a fuck if they get into the chart, or not&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only way I can be, is to say what I see&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And have no shadow hanging over me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vi"&gt;VI.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, I have spent an unhealthy amount of time over the past year thinking about corporate dynamics, and I highly recommend that people, including myself, touch grass more often. If you know of any good grass to touch, please make me aware of it at ludicity.hackernews@gmail.com. So far, I have received two recommendations for fly fishing and nothing else. I don't want to murder our aquatic friends, but I'll be left with little choice at this rate.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/29/</guid></item><item><title>Skin Me Alive</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/skin-me-alive/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently told about a project at a company which involved cleaning up a dataset which consisted of around 100M individual entries - the reason the cleaning is required is that, due to various absolutely fucking dumb decisions, a massive proportion of the dataset were duplicate values. Products were appearing multiple times, for example, and we didn't know which entry was the "real" product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person telling me this was trying to illustrate something about corporate dysfunction. He informs me that millions of dollars were spent and more than a year of time. Then he asks the question deployed worldwide when someone is &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; sure that they're going to blow your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"How many records do you think they deleted?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sits back and waits for the answer. At this point, I have two options. One, assume he's underrated my cynicism, and pick a higher number so that his narrative flow isn't broken. Two, do what my terrible instincts always tell me to do, and pick an absurdly low number so he's forced to revise upwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should do one as an agreeable conversation partner, but I do two because I am a bastard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They deleted... 5,000 records."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His grin widens - he knows what I just tried to do, and I realize that I have grossly miscalculated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Zero. The only outcome from the project was a recommendation to start another project."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some spluttering, I ask, already knowing the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Was anyone fired?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="skin-in-the-game"&gt;Skin In The Game&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The places I've worked have all agonized over the amount of money it costs to hire a single new staff member, and then they'll &lt;em&gt;thoughtlessly&lt;/em&gt; sink ten times that number into a project that &lt;em&gt;literally produced nothing&lt;/em&gt; and no one seems to be held accountable for this. I suspect that at the level where judgement happens, the information has been packaged such that none of the fund-providers are aware that we're just setting their money alight constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, that isn't even the thing that baffles me. &lt;em&gt;Wasting money&lt;/em&gt; is going to happen on individual projects, because it isn't really a waste. That's the cost of doing business. Some things work and other things don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, what's baffling is that &lt;em&gt;nothing ever works&lt;/em&gt; at these places. The same morons make the same stupid mistakes over and over. Projects &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; and the vast majority of the time, anyone with a half ounce of savvy has already realized it is already doomed, doomed, doomed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing works but the money still flows in. If the same people had their Netflix subscriptions cease working for a month, they'd be screaming bloody murder at the injustice they've been dealt, but they'll happily sit in conference rooms and applaud each other's absolutely inane initiatives like seals that someone didn't have the heart to finish clubbing, then produce PowerPoints talking about how the project was an "overall" success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nassim Taleb &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_in_the_Game_(book)"&gt;has written&lt;/a&gt; that this is the natural consequence of not having any real skin in the game. I.e, they aren't going to personally lose anything when their projects don't work out, and they're sufficiently protected by labor laws and sheer &lt;em&gt;distance&lt;/em&gt; to clear outcomes that they aren't going to be fired. And that's that. Some institutions have simply become so large that they can no longer identify where they're bleeding. We frequently can't tell &lt;em&gt;how many people we have employed&lt;/em&gt;, and this seems to not be some sin related to how uniquely incompetent we are, but some inexorable informational decay that happens when any operation becomes this complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the extent that the organization survives and thrives, it is because the core business is so immensely profitable that it produces enough money to keep everyone gainfully employed despite their near-zero productivity. Many of these people are actually hard workers, but have been hired into roles that have no chance of really doing anything for our bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, that core business requires some activities to be done to... if not a high level, at least a level consistent with receiving ongoing business. For reasons I haven't yet worked out to my satisfaction, the people actually &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; the work that produces our lifeblood seem to be paid the least, and the absolutely disposable managers, usually with no understanding of what would benefit the business, are showered in money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no reason to innovate successfully, because to fail in an &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; way is to invite questions about why you tried to succeed (but still failed) instead of sticking to the socially constructed reality that the old way works (when it, historically, guarantees failure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="exit"&gt;Exit&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against incentives such as these, there is no defense. A reader suggested I look into the concepts of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty"&gt;Exit and Voice&lt;/a&gt;, and I did so. My conclusion: within the average large organization, giving Voice to your grievances accomplishes very little because you require some high percentage of collaborators to affect change, and the effect of having even a few people that don't &lt;em&gt;get it&lt;/em&gt; stifles most efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you are largely left with Exit, unless you actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want to spend ten years of your life painstakingly crafting change wherever you work. Which, to be clear, is totally respectable assuming it is actually aligned with your values. I could become deeply invested in improving a process over ten years that improves the survival rate of cancer patients by some tiny amount. I am incapable on a spiritual level of making the duplicate values actually disappear when the organization seems perfectly capable of blundering along with them there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen a few different Exits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A senior engineer at Amazon (in the U.S, so he's a bajillionaire) told me that work is totally pointless and the industry is fucked, so you should &lt;em&gt;slam&lt;/em&gt; the dollar slider all the way to the right and then Exit the rat race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team lead from an organization that does lifesaving work, though burdened by a large mass of absolute morons in charge, decided to Exit the private sector to try and do something meaningful, and if it doesn't work soon, he's Exiting again to accrue massive amounts of money then retire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've got a friend that decided to Exit academia (because it's, in the words of Patrick McKenzie, totally FUBAR'd) who now does whatever minimum amount of work is required to support his habit of rock climbing every day. As I write that, I realize he's Exited capitalism to whatever degree that's possible, and damn the long-term consequences for his retirement fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the youngest publicly listed CEOs in the country told me that his career started when he had to Exit from being non-self-employed because he was fired from his first three jobs due to being &lt;em&gt;super fucking bad&lt;/em&gt; at caring about office stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, some people don't need to Exit. I spoke to some clinical psychologists recently that mentioned they'd keep doing their work a few days a week even if they were unpaid. These people provoked a lot of thought from me, because they really gun down the oft-repeated idea that "work is always meaningless, why are you being stupid and looking for anything there?". In fact, it seems very depressing to me how easy it is to find people repeating this. It probably isn't exactly &lt;a href="https://wiki.lspace.org/Crab_Bucket"&gt;crab bucket&lt;/a&gt; but it feels similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="skin-me-alive"&gt;Skin Me Alive&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some soul searching, many conversations, and much reading, I recently decided to Exit into running my own company with a few friends. Relax, I'm never going to mention it by name or link to it from here. I consider writing here sacrosanct - which is why I'm on this weirdo platform with no ads and the crudest analytics imaginable. But I'll do my best to write about what it feels like to actually have some skin in the game, and whether things are going well or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the reason I wrote all of the above is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few weeks, I've technically &lt;em&gt;lost&lt;/em&gt; a spectacular sum of money. I'm not a bad software engineer, and I get paid accordingly. Working part time to make space to run a bootstrapped company (read: I haven't taken investor money though I could probably raise it easily).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not working full time means I lose a lot of money every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I've written some of the only code since I started my career that I'm actually proud of. I set up our team's infrastructure in a way that seems sensible given our size. We make decisions as a group, but there's no one in my group that I don't respect immensely despite our disagreements. No one is telling me to do things that I know are stupid. The only KPI are those imposed by reality: "are we iterating quickly enough for our own comfort?" and "are we earning any money?". I keep fairly steady office hours and have to do a whole bunch of things I don't like, like talking to accountants, reading about sales, making cold calls, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lifestyle might only be enabled by the fact that I'm still a part time leech, which I'm not particularly proud of, but... well, I'm much happier anyway. At least the office work is for a reason other than stacking money higher and higher. I can't imagine going back to five days a week of mind-numbing drudgery and meetings. Something might actually &lt;em&gt;happen&lt;/em&gt; doing this type of work, even if that thing is total failure that I face consequences for. I think about the people I knew that didn't live to old age, and I feel that life isn't long enough to do things that I'm not happy doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being skinned alive doesn't feel bad so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="email"&gt;Email&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is down here because I love getting reader email, and don't get otherwise. You can reach me at ludicity.hackernews@gmail.com&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/skin-me-alive/</guid></item><item><title>Overconfidence, and Executives as Personality Defect</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/overconfidence-executives-as-personality-defect/</link><description>&lt;h1 id="overconfidence"&gt;Overconfidence&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking a lot about confidence and how absolutely Gross (capital G intentional) it is, and how unpleasant so many of executives I've spoken to have ended up being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, and I would wager most people's experience, confident people succeed. They succeed in degrees that are generally far greater than whatever their actual competence would indicate that they should. They'll succeed despite being &lt;em&gt;obviously and aggressively wrong&lt;/em&gt; to thinking people, time and time again. This is Gross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, it's generally considered to be good advice to 'fake it until you make it', especially for chronically underconfident people. This advice doesn't &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like it's morally wrong to give out. This &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; seem absolutely gross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that we're discussing two kinds of confidence...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Confidence&lt;/em&gt;: Refraining from being too shy to state your mind, or speak up in front of a crowd. The simple ability to speak without appearing rushed or panicked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gross Confidence&lt;/em&gt;: The absolute inability to even &lt;em&gt;notice&lt;/em&gt; that you don't know what you're saying, but sincerely being able to convince yourself that it is probably true, and anyone that disagrees is being a difficult idiot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And two kinds of success...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Success&lt;/em&gt;: Being able to accomplish something that is difficult, despite whatever barriers reality has put in your way. This could be anything from engineering tasks to social problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gross Success&lt;/em&gt;: Being able to achieve nothing more than convincing other people to elevate you. Sometimes this requires success of the non-Gross variety, but it will be delivered by someone else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;confident&lt;/em&gt; person is the one calmly stating their opinion, having done some reading on the topic. They can be reasoned with because they're interested in the problem, and don't shoot 100ccs of ego straight into their veins every morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gross confident person, on the other hand, I've heard them described as simply "running over" reasonable people. This usually takes the form of being willing to go to war on every issue so aggressively that everyone else simply backs down. Someone starts saying something you don't like, and you fucking &lt;em&gt;floor&lt;/em&gt; that gas pedal, making it clear that you will &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; back down, that this person is slowly earning your personal enmity over this minor issue, and you will all be tied down arguing this for hours. The reasonable person backs down. Splat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two sets of behaviors naturally lead to the two different types of success. The former person, being reasonable, is much better at navigating an actual problem. Were I to say "customers really don't like the redesign your team rolled out" with adequate data, they would likely just change it back. The &lt;em&gt;latter&lt;/em&gt; person is going to go to war with me, personally, because I've said that they've made a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a small company, where it &lt;em&gt;really matters&lt;/em&gt; what those customers think, the latter person sinks the company. I've seen that happen once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a company large enough to have an extensive layer of politics and minimal accountability, the latter person &lt;em&gt;is totally fine&lt;/em&gt;. Everyone backs down from the fight because it isn't worth their time to argue with this absolute psycho. There are no consequences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of a large enough organisation for failure to be survivable that &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have tracking of any sort, they'll just assert that Bad Things weren't their fault but Good Things are totally their doing. Or, a line from Patrick McKenzie's &lt;a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/"&gt;advice for young engineers&lt;/a&gt; that is so much truer than I'd ever imagined upon my first reading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Status in well-run businesses generally is awarded to people who successfully take credit for doing one of these things. &lt;strong&gt;(That can, but does not necessarily, entail actually doing them.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Status in a &lt;em&gt;well-run&lt;/em&gt; business can still be hijacked this way. It just takes a little bit more work. How many businesses are even well-run?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="executives"&gt;Executives&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have, for various reasons, access to an anomalously high number of executives in casual settings. My specialty is technology, so most of them are doing work approximately in this space. My time with them is very limited for the most part - they're willing to advise me on many issues, but the total time I've spent talking with each of them probably ranges from an hour to fifty hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All but one of them&lt;/em&gt; has, at some point, despite not that many contact hours, expressed absolute confidence in something around technology that they were &lt;em&gt;totally fucking wrong&lt;/em&gt; on. I mean, not a little bit wrong, just dead to rights caught talking absolute nonsense. To a degree that people I have spent &lt;em&gt;much more time than that&lt;/em&gt; with have never been with such certainty. Executives seem to get things confidently wrong at astonishing rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent example, with only minor obfuscation, is a Chief Technology Officer of an organization being absolutely convinced their security team has been capable for years of breaking through a security measure that every cryptographer in the world hasn't been able to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the occasions where I've offered &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; form of gentle correction they have almost always doubled down, and in some cases revised their opinion of me downwards. &lt;em&gt;Usually&lt;/em&gt; they have then gone to another party and said something disparaging about me, but they quickly forget about the slight and we're on good terms the next day - the capriciousness of it all is even more unbalancing, and makes one reluctant to offer contrary opinions, though that's an element of the dynamic for a psychologist to unpack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why am I going to them for advice if they're so wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect is as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray [Gell-Mann]’s case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward—reversing cause and effect. I call these the “wet streets cause rain” stories. Paper’s full of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know. - &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/65213-briefly-stated-the-gell-mann-amnesia-effect-is-as-follows-you"&gt;Michael Crichton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work hard to exercise some level of humility (and, like many engineers, this has been hard for me in the past), and this resulted in me just &lt;em&gt;assuming&lt;/em&gt; they know what they're talking about in other domains. They have a lot of experience, after all. Sure, they're kind of full of shit on topics I know about, but the rest of what they're saying makes a lot of sense. Which topics do they make sense on? &lt;em&gt;Only&lt;/em&gt; the ones I don't know about? Oh fuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps they're right on &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; topics, but they sound equally right across all domains by projecting Gross confidence, and despite their stories about all their great victories, I've never seen evidence they can achieve anything other than Gross success. To be clear, I haven't seen evidence that many of them &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; achieve regular success, but at some point you begin to wonder if they just got to where they are by talking a good game and stealing credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practically, any CEO who "rose through the ranks" is competent at being an actor. No exception. - &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1151666832702615553?lang=en"&gt;Nassim Taleb, being his usual self&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this quote &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; writing most of this, and in this context, Taleb talks about "rising through the ranks" as starting at a large organization and working your way up, as opposed to creating your own business where you need to be able to achieve non-Gross success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And, if I'm being honest, a lot of the entrepreneurs I meet, at least the charismatic ones in the tech space, hardly strike me as being wise or reasoned, so maybe that elevates people to power who are awful in a different way.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="personality-defect"&gt;Personality Defect&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last thing I'd wondered about is whether this behavior is a &lt;em&gt;deliberate&lt;/em&gt; strategy or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At my first job, I got to spend a lot of time working with salespeople. It was at a small startup, and the product was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; good. I remember walking out of the first failed sale we had, and being struck by how &lt;em&gt;annoyed&lt;/em&gt; the guy teaching me was at the potential customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They're small time players, and don't know a good opportunity when it's knocking right at their door."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This otherwise smart guy had honest-to-God convinced himself that our product was good. He &lt;em&gt;believed&lt;/em&gt; it, and that was why he was generally an effective salesperson. It has been years, but I haven't finished wrestling with the implication that people are capable of doing this. Of course, we all believe things that are stupid when it's emotionally convenient, but this product was &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, and it also wasn't like it should have meant that much to him. He could get another job easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later, I was approached by the executive suite at a major cryptocurrency platform to be their lead analyst in a market expansion. I personally think the technology is vaguely interesting, but that the majority of the people working in this space are disgusting grifters, frothing at the mouth at the prospect of easy money - but I needed job security given my immigration status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For political reasons, a ton of the C-suite wanted to interview me personally. All but one of them expressed extreme stupidity around topics they should have known much more about, and the smart one was removed in a coup within a month. In particular, I recall their CFO asked me if I (one person) could build a real-time machine learning platform to perform sentiment analysis on news sources and thus beat the markets for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like a CFO should, without having any technical knowledge, understand that it is extremely unlikely that &lt;em&gt;one guy under the age of 30&lt;/em&gt; isn't going to be able to hack for three months and consistently beat the market... I'm not going to waste anyone's time explaining the technical reasons for this &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; why the CFO can figure this out without those reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more importantly, after all those discussions had dropped off, and I'd resumed normal life... I realized that the guy originally teaching me sales had moved into cryptocurrency. In fact, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the salespeople I worked with had moved into cryptocurrency &lt;em&gt;except the ones who ever expressed any doubt&lt;/em&gt;. It's just striking me now - that CFO was in a one-on-one conversation with someone who had nothing to really offer them. There was nothing to gain from talking to me about A.I in this way. She had simply convinced herself that their terrible crypto platform had value, that they could beat the market if they tried for two months, and that crypto was going "to the moon", and this mindset manifested as saying total nonsense to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's just a personality that will just &lt;em&gt;decide&lt;/em&gt; whatever attracts money and status is correct. The latest manifestation of this I've seen in the workplace has been trying to talk about ChatGPT as much as possible, from people that barely know what a LLM is, and frankly have never used the product beyond ten minutes of playing around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, to make things worse, it &lt;em&gt;can't be turned off&lt;/em&gt;. In the above, they've obviously made out like bandits from their poor behavior. But I have, and I swear this is true, seen an executive in a similar position (who now holds the equivalent of a knighthood in the country we're discussing) eat a dish at a restaurant that was incorrectly delivered to their table. They then asked the waiter to bring the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; meal at no additional cost, and when a small child at the table piped up to point out this terrible behavior, they &lt;em&gt;shushed the child&lt;/em&gt;. Like, what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It &lt;em&gt;doesn't seem to be a strategy&lt;/em&gt;. These people are surely capable of &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; degree of strategy, but the fundamentally terrible nature of their being comes naturally to them. There is no reason someone in their position should ever behave that way. It's embarrassing and actively harmful to their reputations, but &lt;em&gt;they just can't stop&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security team can crack that cryptography, because saying that right now gives me status in the conversation. You're wrong if you say that's not possible, because that lowers my status. Argument over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course you're an idiot for not buying this product - it can't be my fault we've lost money, and I'm not a liar for saying the product is good. Argument over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, of course we need better analytics at the organization, I'm data driven. No, I'm not going to invest any time in making the data accurate, that would require not ticking as many boxes off in the next status update. There is no contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we should talk about ChatGPT, because it's the trendy thing and makes me seem like an expert. No, I'd never &lt;em&gt;read about how it works&lt;/em&gt; despite claiming it's the most important thing in the industry at the moment. There is no contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All our social processes seem to be largely selecting for absolute &lt;em&gt;lunatics&lt;/em&gt; at the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I killed Superman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I killed Super-man,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and how ironic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That I'd be the bad guy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;kryptonite, the green chronic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="superman"&gt;Superman&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I moved to the developed world, I worked at a fairly sketchy startup that had branches in a few developing countries. It was my first job after university, and the staff were pretty impressive (on paper). For the most part, we had graduates holding international degrees, which is considered incredibly prestigious in my home country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details and eventually failure of the business were interesting, but for another time. Instead, I wanted to talk about someone that worked there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the business to function, we required a fair number of staff to deliver goods every hour. The orders would come in with little warning, and we had very tight timelines. To make things worse, traffic could get extremely bad in this city, with ten minute journeys easily extending to 1-2 hour slogs depending on the time of day. And on top of it all, we had to try turn a profit on items with a very low margin, so our team of drivers consisted entirely of the most minimum wage people we could possibly find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter Mostafa. He's Superman in this story. He does not actually die or get into an accident, in case you were worried about reading something extremely grim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't name him Superman - that was a name that management and the other riders gave him. I saw riders now instead of drivers, because this was the secret sauce we used to hit our daily targets. We used motorcyclists for the vast majority of our orders, because... well, the truth is, the fastest way to get around the city was to weave through traffic incredibly dangerously. It's a common practice where I'm from, so I didn't think too much about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; strike me as concerning was that every shipment that looked like it'd be a little bit dicey would go straight to Superman. In fact, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is why he was called Superman - it was because he was constantly pulling off deliveries that none of the other staff could, by recklessly endangering his life and absolutely flooring the accelerator every day. I rode alongside one of these guys when they were &lt;em&gt;slowly&lt;/em&gt; weaving through traffic to drop off some flyers, and it was immediately apparent to me that just asking someone to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; on a motorcycle in the country wasn't safe (a fact borne out by data), let alone asking them to speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now things take on a slightly more grim tone. Management called him Superman to praise him for risking his life... to what? Ship some boxes around in an hour instead of two? And I really mean it when I say that he was risking his life. The road fatality rate in my home country is more than three times higher than that of most developed countries when you &lt;em&gt;aren't&lt;/em&gt; zooming around at max speed in peak traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's why we call him Superman," they'd say in some sickening, obviously insincere attempt at doing awe, "he always saves the day".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manager for our country's branch at the time was a Harvard graduate, and was essentially in charge of our operations across the entire country. All in all, an incredibly impressive corporate persona, particularly in this part of the world, where the cost of the plane ticket to Harvard was more than most people would see in many months - indeed, a quick calculation right now reveals that it would have taken Superman ten months salary (assuming he spends no money on anything) to afford a one-way trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manager had a LinkedIn profile had the usual stuff about being deeply committed to the good of society. However, when I raised the two major social harms we were committing (the staff were illegally paid below minimum wage and, you know, fucking risking their lives), that was the only time they lost their temper with me. "We have no choice!", they would say, collecting anywhere between 20-40 times this guy's salary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't know what else to do, so I quietly worked for a bit, then left a few months later for largely unrelated reasons. I'm still ashamed of that. I'd like to think that these days I would have blown the whistle somehow, but I didn't back then, and I've got to come to terms with that. I think the saddest thing that I remember is how management would buy all the ground staff KFC every Friday, and how desperately pleased the ground staff were with that. As if they were so used to being exploited that they considered their lot in life pretty good if it was exploitation &lt;em&gt;plus&lt;/em&gt; the cheapest fast food we could find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one died, but that had nothing to do with me. I helped us play Russian roulette with their lives because some dickhead CEO in another country wanted to pretend to be a real businessman with other people's money, and that dude &lt;em&gt;demanded&lt;/em&gt; we rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic slightly faster. What would have happened if Superman &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; get hit by a car? How much guilt would I bear for that? Do I bear any &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; guilt because this particular chamber of the gun was empty?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting, I wonder how often I kill Superman right now, in my current job. It's easier to think about the consequences of my actions when they're so clear - death was obviously on the table for Superman. But now I enable a dysfunctional system even though I don't have to - realistically, I wouldn't be fired if I started calling a manager out every time they lied with our labor protections, but I'd quickly become seen as "difficult" or "confrontational". That threat is enough to keep me largely quiet and civil, while we shuffle other people's money (drawing most of it as salary for ourselves) and send our colleagues into existential crises around the meaning of their work-lives, take them away from their children, betray society in a thousand small ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see other immigrants, locked into jobs they despise, paid a fraction of what the rest of us earn, because no one is willing to stand up to an executive in front of everyone and say "You can't treat people like that just because you have leverage - not while I'm here."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've worked with researchers who have fudged data via p-hacking and deliberate stupidity, despite ostensibly working in the healthcare sector, essentially stealing millions from the public and harming patients on top of that, and no one says anything because the problem is too big, and they'll just get in trouble. Or abused their students for labor. Conned confused 20 year olds into PhDs by targeting them when they were bereft of direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know a few people who have become so stressed from work and the questions surrounding how to have a meaningful life that they've become chronically ill - they tap out entirely, lose the ability to sleep for long periods, develop nervous tics, or otherwise endure enough harm to make you weep to see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what the right thing to do is. Morally, I'd feel a lot better speaking up. Practically, I suspect that I &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; lose my job, would definitely lose all chances of promotion, and all to get ignored anyway. But I don't think silence is the best we can do, and frankly, sometimes I've done worse than silence for my own selfish ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Superman was all right in the end, but I worry about the universe where he wasn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you understand what I'm saying?" shouted Moist. "You can't just go around killing people!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Why Not? You Do." The golem lowered his arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What?" snapped Moist. "I do not! Who told you that?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I Worked It Out. You Have Killed Two Point Three Three Eight People," said the golem calmly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I have never laid a finger on anyone in my life, Mr Pump. I may be–– all the things you know I am, but I am not a killer! I have never so much as drawn a sword!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No, You Have Not. But You Have Stolen, Embezzled, Defrauded And Swindled Without Discrimination, Mr Lipvig. You Have Ruined Businesses And Destroyed Jobs. When Banks Fail, It Is Seldom Bankers Who Starve. Your Actions Have Taken Money From Those Who Had Little Enough To Begin With. In A Myriad Small Ways You Have Hastened The Deaths Of Many. You Do Not Know Them. You Did Not See Them Bleed. But You Snatched Bread From Their Mouths And Tore Clothes From Their Backs. For Sport, Mr Lipvig. For Sport. For The Joy Of The Game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-killed-superman/</guid></item><item><title>Obviously Wrong</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/obviously-wrong/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, I came across &lt;a href="https://mindingourway.com/obvious-advice/"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; talking about how often we don't take obvious advice. A few instances of this spring right to mind. For example, my gym schedule was badly disrupted by Covid, and I never got back into it. I &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; should, but I haven't yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatively benign, but we can think of other cases where this is true. In David Whyte's &lt;em&gt;The Three Marriages&lt;/em&gt; (a deeply soulful and philosophical book despite the fact it looks like self-help on the cover) has written about how hard it is to convince someone &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to enter into a relationship, no matter how obvious it is that they shouldn't. Speaking from experience, he says that they're going to do it, and all the advice in the world won't turn them away. And certainly, we've all been advised to do something very obvious before starting an endeavour and then just... not done it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what really got me thinking was a friend that ran his job search strategy by me. He laid out what he was doing, and asked me what I thought. I've given plenty of people advice on this topic (why they come to me, a decidedly inexperienced person, I will never know) and it occurred to me that I had nothing to say for once. Because he was doing nothing that was &lt;em&gt;obviously wrong&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="obvious-and-wrong"&gt;Obvious and Wrong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether something is wrong is a function of reality. If you stick your hand in an electrical socket, that will be terrible for you. Whether it was &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; wrong depends entirely on whether you know what an electrical socket is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I've been thinking about is that your capabilities and intuitions around these two axes (obviousness and wrongness) move at very different speeds as you age. There are plenty of little tricks in various sports that might be the &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt; play at any given moment, were it not for the minor inconvenience of not being skilled enough to pull them off. That is, as I practice, I am decreasing the number of &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; options and increasing the number of &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; options. When I can't actually land any three-pointers, shooting three-pointers is always wrong. Increasing the amount of right in my decision space relative to the wrong in my decision space is slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I can &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; easily shift my intuitions around absolute blunders. I read Patrick McKenzie's post on &lt;a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/"&gt;salary negotiation&lt;/a&gt; and it has earned me around $60,000 over the past two years in &lt;em&gt;one evening&lt;/em&gt;. That's &lt;em&gt;insane&lt;/em&gt;. That is, there are now plenty of things that are obviously wrong to me in this domain. For example, I always had the ability to ask for more money, but it wasn't obvious to me to just... do it. Everyone I know who has ever done this in a salary negotiation seems to have gotten it eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's the endless field of startups that obviously built something no one wants to buy. It takes a few minutes of Googling to save you &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; of pain. Make sure someone wants to buy the damn thing before you make it. Easy. This has nothing to do with your ability to execute, but everything to do with your ability to learn from other people's mistakes, although you do have to execute something at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I received some guidance on why exactly &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/the-corporate-facade-is-more-complicated-than-i-thought/"&gt;we pretend things aren't bad at work&lt;/a&gt;, my entire perspective on how to be helpful to the organisation shifted instantly. I can't imagine how many years it took that guy to figure some of this stuff out, and he has the skill to navigate it more effectively than myself, but now entire categories of action are &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; wrong to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're learning adequately from people's mistakes or writing, it feels like slowly being constricted - or at least, I hope I'm learning adequately, and that's how I feel. Endless fields of possibility get shut down, and then I pry open a tiny bit through focused study when I actually get guidance on how to perform sales effectively, or how to operate a particular library, or how to have difficult conversations with people I love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But&lt;/em&gt; there is something a little bit hackable here, which is you tend to get a lot of early gains out of first studying something in &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; domains. That is, when I started learning Python, my perspective on what is obvious and wrong shifted dramatically. A whole way to deal with problems had emerged (so manual work was both wrong and obviously wrong), and the same applies to basically every domain I've tried to actually learn from existing resources, from having better relationships to philosophy. I'm not weird enough to deploy some obsessive strategy of jumping into as many new fields as possible at this point in my life, but maybe I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be that weird, and maybe it's worth adjusting the dial in that direction just a tiny bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, a small takeaway that my friend ultimately found comforting - if there's nothing obviously wrong, then he's doing the best that he can do. It's good that he checked, because sometimes it's obvious to someone else, who can make it obvious to you. And if something &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; obviously wrong, you actually have to stop doing it, which is sometimes inexplicably hard. But you know what, when he's kicking himself in a year because something was wrong, at least he'll know for sure that, at the time, he really checked that it wasn't obvious.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/obviously-wrong/</guid></item><item><title>The Corporate Facade Is More Complicated Than I Thought</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/the-corporate-facade-is-more-complicated-than-i-thought/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A note from the future: I no longer believe the corporate facade is complicated. It is complicated in that there are many factors at play and many of the actors in the system believe in the beautiful vision, but the truth is that it's all an elaborate justification for getting money and status without producing value. If you're already what a friend of mine terms "post-cynical", feel free to skip this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Monday, I wrote about &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/most-data-work-seems-fundamentally-worthless/"&gt;most data work I've witnessed seems fundamentally worthless&lt;/a&gt;. A lot of my time over the past few months has been dedicated to figuring out what that perspective means for my career. It was also &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/compliments/"&gt;very quickly suggested that I need professional help&lt;/a&gt;, which was very funny. Anyway, given the amount of traction that post got, it's clear that it resonated, though I am not closed to the possibility that we all need therapy. It &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; made me like I'm what happens when you put the Mouth of Sauron in an office job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that has always worked out for me is noticing when I'm confused and seeking clarity, and I have been utterly perplexed as to how some people seemed fine with the grind. I have seen staff go so far above and beyond, hammering out Python to crunch spreadsheets to drag-and-drop PowerBI visuals to tick off Jira tickets to please stakeholders who &lt;em&gt;didn't read the damn things&lt;/em&gt;. And at the same time, I've seen plenty of managers who managed to turn up for their team every day, attending the endless, thankless meetings where their peers spouted off absolute bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn't always a mystery. Some of them just had kids, the pay is comfortable, and there are things in life that are more important than your personal happiness at all moments, so they make do. But for the others, what gives? Did they just vaguely believe that they were going to live forever and this was a good way to spend their blessed hours on this green earth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, instead of just guessing at what's really going on, I asked some of them to mentor me. These are my thoughts on a three hour conversation with the most insightful (or at least, most willing to share that insight with me) people manager I've met thus far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="does-our-super-senior-leadership-know-that-things-are-fucked-up"&gt;Does our super senior leadership know that things are fucked up?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had the fortune (and sometimes, incredible misfortune) of being exposed to a fair number of people in the C-suite, and they're always a mystery to me. Here's a pro-tip for young programmers - most people in the business don't give two shits about code quality, developer practices, or any of that jazz &lt;em&gt;unless you convince them that it is affecting something that makes them look bad&lt;/em&gt;. I mention this because, well, it's common for us to feel misaligned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executives and directors were this strange class of person who seemed to be constantly engaged with the most obnoxious part of work (arguing with people, being obviously lied to, and obviously lying), and did none of the parts that seemed particularly ensouled to me (programming, some forms of manual labour, teaching, whatever). And despite this, many of them turn up smiling-faced, day-after-day, and proceed as if their spirits aren't slowly being compacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few possibilities occurred to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flicker of humanity that drives the rest of us to despair has long since been extinguished in them, leaving dead-eyed automatons that exist only to repeat that the project is currently Red, but if we just demonstrate a level of competence that we clearly don't possess or we wouldn't be here in the first place, we could be back to Green soon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They realized that they need to turn up and play the game as aggressively as possible to ensure that their children had the best possible opportunities in life vis-à-vis whatever money can buy for them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're absolute sociopaths, either from a young age, or after being exposed to sycophants for dozens of years&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're deeply incompetent, and the organisation is enough of a sham that somehow this is totally okay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their direct reports have successfully woven a web of deceit around them so compelling that they &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; think everything is okay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're perfectly aware that everything is terrible and want to do better, but management at that level is engaged in some horrific game-theoretic dilemma where anyone that defects by not lying about their success is immediately eaten alive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main one here that didn't feel right to me was the dead-eyed automaton theory. I don't think people can actually become that dead inside from mere office drudgery, but I didn't know for sure. The others were all certainly possible, but a person suppressing all traces of humanity on a deep level seemed a bridge too far. But then again, whenever I've heard a lawyer describing what it takes to be a partner at a major legal firm, I also think that humans can't possibly put those hours in, yet here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And guess what! I finally got some clarity! Someone way up there in an organization I'm familiar with sat down and answered every question I had with brutal honesty. Here's everything that came up in the discussion over three hours, in an increasingly dark and spooky office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="are-they-dead-eyed-automata"&gt;Are they dead-eyed automata?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my relief, I've so far failed to uncover anyone forced into this lamentable position thus far. Each person that I thought might be like this, at least where I've worked, has in fact been a human with real interests and dreams. That probably sounds like a stupid thing to confirm, but I have done it nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="are-they-grifting-because-people-rely-on-them"&gt;Are they grifting because people rely on them?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn't touch on this one - but I know enough people who tolerate their horrific non-management jobs that a few of them must be in this position. Even if they're not terribly unhappy, it's obvious that economic realities can easily force people to do things that they'd otherwise prefer not to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="are-they-sickos"&gt;Are they sickos?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn't cover this one either, but I can tell you that I've certainly met a few people who would likely qualify. I worked, very briefly, for a CEO that was born incredibly wealthy, and spent all his time playing his subordinates off against each other in sick games. He'd call my manager and just scream that sales had to be doubled by the end of the week... &lt;em&gt;or else&lt;/em&gt;. I don't know what the &lt;em&gt;or else&lt;/em&gt; actually would have been, but it certainly sounded concerning at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also met people who will simply assert they are correct and then fucking &lt;em&gt;bulldoze&lt;/em&gt; anyone that gets in their way mercilessly. I fortunately haven't worked with such a person, but I can confirm that I've met some that are very successful. In my experience, it isn't a strategy so much as a horrific personality defect - they are like this in all settings. They do this to their friends, family, waiters, leveraging overwhelming, reality-rewriting conviction that they are correct, you are wrong, and no, they &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; said the thing that they clearly said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, they are usually terrible at their jobs in addition to obviously being incredibly abusive. Being good at their jobs would require learning, which would require changing what they're doing, which would mean admitting that they're wrong, and these people will sooner lay you into the barren earth than admit to being wrong, unless they're trying to self-signal that they must be good people because they admitted they were wrong that one time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this seems to largely work for them. No idea how. We'll figure that out later. My only advice is to get &lt;em&gt;as far away as physically possible&lt;/em&gt; if you feel that you're near one of these people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="are-they-deeply-incompetent"&gt;Are they deeply incompetent?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, some people are. I don't know how they end up in such senior positions in the cases where they weren't just born into it or one of the people that simply bulldoze everyone. It's mind boggling. It's partially explained by things like the incentives in government, but sometimes they're so astoundingly bad that I still feel that I'm missing something. Mark me down as 'still kinda confused' on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="do-they-live-in-a-direct-report-constructed-fantasy-land"&gt;Do they live in a direct report constructed fantasy land?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, now we get to the real spicy meatball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of them certainly do - &lt;em&gt;but the degree to which that is true varies intensely&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take it on faith that no one has the time or expertise to personally investigate what's going on in the organisation at both enough breadth and depth to formulate a clear picture of what's happening themselves. I don't think that's a difficult proposition. For example, I can evaluate a codebase pretty well, but I must concede that I don't understand a thing about our finances beyond the crudest of details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I have been told by someone in the C-suite that your main job at a company is frequently managing what information reaches &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; manager. Probably obvious from observing behaviour, but helpful to have articulated. This is probably why the same people who reported having fulfilling data jobs were quite close to areas that make money - you can certainly fudge numbers a bit, but if you're operating at a huge loss then people are probably going to find out eventually, so the bullshit opportunities are substantially smaller. I assume. Whenever I've been near the money, it has been in a startup with a fundamentally unviable business model (i.e, earning money was never an option), so we're in the realm of pure theorycraft, which is always a dangerous thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here we have an executive acknowledging that it's well-known that your main job in management is to package information into inoffensive (and, if you're doing poorly, as most places are, misleading) tidbits to go into a PowerPoint presentation somewhere upstream. My mistake here was thinking that this could &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; be done for the benefit of whoever is doing the lying. It's the hip and cynical take that makes you feel wise. What is &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; happening is that this massaged version of reality can be of instrumental value further up the chain, and with the right people in charge, it can be part of the convoluted process of &lt;em&gt;actually making things better&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say you have some data project that was poorly scoped from the very beginning. I've been reading &lt;a href="http://mlebook.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Machine Learning Engineering&lt;/em&gt; by Andriy Burkov&lt;/a&gt; (cool book, by the way!), and it opens with all the ways that you can &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; create a functioning machine learning project that accomplishes no business objectives. So let's imagine we've done one of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if you aren't measuring outputs in any meaningful way, then you can report that this project's capabilities have been made available to thousands of staff, it's revolutionizing the industry, your partner thinks you've become more attractive upon deployment, and your first project that wasn't a dashboard no one reads is a resounding success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone smart will know this isn't true. All the engineers know this isn't true. We are incredibly demoralized as we watch the managers take a victory lap, pat themselves on the back, &lt;em&gt;thank us for the terrible work we know we've done&lt;/em&gt;. What I was gratified to hear is that some executives actually &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; the whole enterprise is a total hack fraud, but reporting the success allows them to secure resourcing to &lt;em&gt;do better next time, for everyone's sake&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, yes, we're constructing a fantasy land together, but it really &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be together, not just one manager throwing everyone's dreams under the bus. We can't have meetings where we discuss this as an explicit strategy, but with a wink and a nudge, when you have the right people who actually care about each other, we're all grifting &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt; for a better future. We have to abuse the terrible output tracking collectively to get the resources we need to &lt;em&gt;actually create output&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="are-they-in-a-gigantic-game-theory-problem"&gt;Are they in a gigantic game theory problem?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll get back to the previous point in a second, because it's the main thing worth discussing. But yes, senior management &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; in a dilemma. If they're honest, someone else will eat their funding. You have two options: play the game or don't play the game (i.e, lose by default).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-does-this-mean"&gt;What does this mean?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, my immediate take is that it becomes very hard to evaluate what kind of senior leadership you're dealing with from the ground. The problem is that, since they are all playing the game and can't announce that they are doing so in front of everyone, they can only tell you how they really feel in private. If almost all the realities above result in leadership saying the same things, it's &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard to tell what's happening. It's like a murder suspect pleading Not Guilty. That's &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what a murderer would say!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it matters massively who you're working with, as always. If I'm your manager and you send me some nicely massaged information, it's basically up to me to decide what to do with it. There will be a layer of management that will receive this beautiful lie, and they will then have the option of betraying everything you hold dear, or they will try to protect everyone's jobs and create a happy organisation. In fact, I now realize that if everyone is aligned - that is, everyone is on the same side with the same goal and we &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; this is the case - then the fabric we're constructing is an exercise in cooperation, not malice. We are weaving a wondrous multi-hued fabric of a hypothetical better future, passed from hand to hand, until the CEO finally &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-will-fucking-dropkick-you-if-you-use-that-spreadsheet/"&gt;kills our last fucking spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;. I think I understand now why people talk so much about the value of vision in leadership. It's obvious at places that produce effectively, and seems almost offensive at places that don't perform well, but it is a &lt;em&gt;strategy&lt;/em&gt; at the latter place to &lt;em&gt;become&lt;/em&gt; the former place. I need to know what helpful lies to weave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I have no idea what type of person is generally attracted to the executive level, because see point one, so it's hard to stay motivated without that insider intel on how the managers are actually aligned. You're liable to spend years working on something like this, then someone up the chain turns the fabric into a cool suit, nails a job interview with it, and guess what! You just wasted years of your precious life so some millionaire can be &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; of a millionaire. Reading books like Robert Jackall's &lt;em&gt;Moral Mazes&lt;/em&gt; (which I should finish, whereupon I will probably find out it has discussed all of this) leads me to believe that there is some intense selective pressure for pretty awful people in many industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, you must play the game, or move into an industry (or startup, or launch your own thing) where you have real exposure to consequences and reality. Nassim Taleb has prescribed this as the antidote to bullshit in his book, &lt;em&gt;Skin in the Game&lt;/em&gt;. If you try to avoid playing the game where too many actors don't have skin in the game, or if the consequences are too far removed from the present moment, avoiding the game means you're default dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourthly, some of the work I thought was worthless (admittedly, a lot of it was still worthless, and I feel bad for people doing Business As Usual tasks under such a regime) was actually helping good people fight the good fight, just in an ethically ambiguous way. It's unclear to me about whether I'm happy to trade years off a relatively short life to nudge this ship ever-so-slightly in the right direction. It's certainly less discouraging to think that my focus on good engineering is applying a teeny, tiny vector that moves the entire enterprise in a better direction, rather than being literally completely worthless in principle. The real issue is that, given the right colleagues, it's worth lots but isn't the right strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifthly, man, I've thought about this a lot more than the average person (I think) and I still have no idea what the fuck is going on or what I should do next. Someone also just reminded me about how much time was wasted talking about Agile as a solution to our delivery problems (it was neither better nor worse), so there's probably some further questions about whether we've got people &lt;em&gt;good enough&lt;/em&gt; to implement whatever the vision of the day might be. Sign me up for some of that therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/the-corporate-facade-is-more-complicated-than-i-thought/</guid></item><item><title>I Will Fucking Dropkick You If You Use That Spreadsheet</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-will-fucking-dropkick-you-if-you-use-that-spreadsheet/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;There are a few things that inspire deep revulsion in me. The episode of Star Trek: Voyager I just watched was pretty gross. I definitely saw some pretty bad roadkill on my daily walks during the Covid lockdowns. But nothing - &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; - comes close to the white hot fury that radiates from me the moment someone suggests plugging a spreadsheet into some sort of automated process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sane engineer would come to you, palms upturned, arms wide, and preach the virtues of Excel in a conciliatory tone. "It really empowers non-technical staff", they would say. "The democratization of data is an important element to the modern workplace, and it is an incredible testament to Excel's flexibility that it has enabled so many people to leverage the power of computing."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that is a mere sane engineer, the first to die in the revolution, and when you have seen enough of what happens when you yield to this blatant &lt;em&gt;cowardice&lt;/em&gt;, you move beyond mere &lt;em&gt;sanity&lt;/em&gt;, into righteous logic so cold that it burns like fire. I tell you now, if you suggest that we put that spreadsheet &lt;em&gt;anywhere near any process&lt;/em&gt;, no force on this planet will save you from me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="but-why-not"&gt;But Why Not?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure it seems like a good idea right now. I'm sure it does. It &lt;em&gt;always does&lt;/em&gt;. "They're already used to filling out the spreadsheets, and we can make sure of the information without changing any processes." I am deeply sympathetic, and will feel bad as I haymaker you through ten cycles of reincarnation. I don't want to do this, but you've forced my hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen a multi-million dollar analytics platform that is dynamically constructed from Excel spreadsheets. Do you think that was the intention when the damn thing was being assembled? Do you think &lt;em&gt;any sane person&lt;/em&gt; would ever want to do that? No, of course not. &lt;em&gt;One&lt;/em&gt; script got written that could parse a spreadsheet, and next thing you know, you're running a greedy search algorithm every sprint, and it never quite makes sense to spend the time removing them. Now you've got fucking twenty, and I am hunting you on a deserted island. Was it worth it? Was it worth it, you absolute son of a bitch?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't have to &lt;em&gt;live like this&lt;/em&gt;. I've gotten through my whole career without understanding how to use VLOOKUP. It's possible, I swear. Just put the spreadsheet down and we can work with databases. Do you remember databases, and possibly happiness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="but-i-wrote-this-great-vba-macro-that-"&gt;But I Wrote This Great VBA Macro That -&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuck you. Well, actually it's great that you've shown that initiative and learned that skill, and it shows that you have the ability to do this in a better way. I will support anything you decide to do as long as it isn't in that spreadsheet. I'll do anything. &lt;em&gt;Anything&lt;/em&gt;. And if you don't take me up on that offer, then I'll see you hang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know how absolutely out of control VBA can get? I worked at a non-profit once that produced reports for the federal government by processing millions of medical records in one gigantic Access script. It took two senior engineers &lt;em&gt;months&lt;/em&gt; to even partially unravel the mess, and it was &lt;em&gt;well-written&lt;/em&gt;. Do you know how it happened? They got one thing done, and then they &lt;em&gt;executed a greedy search algorithm and kept adding one more thing to the script&lt;/em&gt;. But it stops here, you've left me no choice and if I see a single line of VBA, you and I will forever be at war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-about-sharepoint-"&gt;What About SharePoint -&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't you even goddamn talk to me about SharePoint lists. Don't you &lt;em&gt;dare&lt;/em&gt;. The goddamn access key juggling when you want API access, the endless discussions with ITS because no one knows how the damn thing even works. Did you know that the names in the API response can't be changed after you've made the sheet, even if on the webpage you've renamed them? I will kill ten sharks with my bare hands if it means that I can draw even a drop of your blood. If you make me manually map unnamed_column_1 to 50 to fields in a database again, then &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; have initiated violence against &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, and the horror that ensues will be self-defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know why all these processes are run through SharePoint sites? &lt;em&gt;Someone stored one thing, greedy search algorithm, you get it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="but-its-really-only-temporary"&gt;But It's Really Only Temporary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How fucking dumb do you think I am? It's always temporary. It's always just this one time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know how many times I've written a script that was really only run once? &lt;em&gt;Never&lt;/em&gt;. It has &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; happened across my entire career. Every single thing I've ever written has been fucking welded into the soul of every organisation I've ever worked at. They'll never get rid of any of it. My sins will echo for eternity, and I will be damned if I let anyone else get away with what I have. I will send you straight to hell and meet you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you really, sincerely, think that you're only going to use it just this once? Well, I'm sorry, all the goodwill in the universe around this particular topic has been used up, and instead of taking it out on me, I will hand you a longsword and we can hunt down those responsible together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you think that you're going to replace this before starting any new work, you know who doesn't care? The stakeholder that's going to, as if psychic, flood our inbox with tickets tagged URGENT every time we talk about decommissioning the spreadsheets. Microsoft pays them to keep Excel in circulation. They've struck a bargain with the Devil and live an extra hour every time a person highlights cells to look for errors. Okay, fine, I don't know why they want to stop us, but they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we're going to look at our tasks, see the stakeholder screaming at us, and &lt;em&gt;we're going to execute a greedy search algorithm, keeping the spreadsheet around forever&lt;/em&gt;. It's like goddamn gravity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="i-dont-have-any-other-tools"&gt;I Don't Have Any Other Tools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deeply sympathetic. Still have to kill you. I'm so sorry. I really am. I don't do this out of hatred, but out of duty. Someone has to stop you, and I'm sorry that it's me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once worked with a database, where the entire daily data extraction process for business consumption was a batch script that fired off a spreadsheet, that spreadsheet contained a list of other spreadsheets and some VBA, which looped through the list of other spreadsheets, copied them to new folders to be used by staff, and those copied files then executed SQL against a database to have yesterday's data in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about how clever someone would have to be to construct a process when given only those tools. Think about how someone that clever could &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; have meant for it to stay this way - they had the best of intentions. Such a person is far smarter than I, and it is with deep regret that I wring the life from their mortal coil. In the words of Rich Burlew, "Intentions matter only in absence of results. And then, only for the blaming."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="all-my-colleagues-use-spreadsheets"&gt;All My Colleagues Use Spreadsheets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will come for them too. I have a friend in Southeast Asia who has exactly one job - he is paid a grotesque amount of money to automate Google Sheets for an e-commerce company. Do you think &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; was the original plan? Everyone at the company is incapable of working with anything else, and you know what, that isn't an excuse because you can &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt;. And if you cannot learn from Google, then you will learn when I yell, when I point, when I beat you with my stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="this-is-gatekeeping"&gt;This Is Gatekeeping&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;. I have put this gate here and I am keeping it &lt;em&gt;for a reason&lt;/em&gt;. The last time I stopped keeping this gate, I wrote a Python script that took a spreadsheet as an input, ran regular expressions in it against a database, spat out ten more spreadsheets, then used those to power a generic PowerBI template which had to have all ten spreadsheet targets repointed by hand. This became one of the most requested services my team performed for several months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone should have fucking stopped me, and I must pay for my crimes by keeping this gate &lt;em&gt;forever&lt;/em&gt;. I swear to you, there is nothing good past this gate. Turn away. Turn away. I beg you, turn away. Beyond this lies naught but trying to work out why all the numbers are wrong, only to realize that Excel thought those IDs were integers and dropped all the leading zeroes. This death is a &lt;em&gt;kindness&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="this-is-unreasonable"&gt;This Is Unreasonable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do I seem like a reasonable person?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-should-i-do-instead"&gt;What Should I Do Instead?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anything&lt;/em&gt;. I am begging you on my hands and knees, &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;. Write a SQLite database on your local hard drive. Do some garbage in Python. Encode the data in binary using a series of pebbles on your front lawn. If necessary, I will personally call your manager and explain the problem. I will &lt;em&gt;actually do this&lt;/em&gt;. It's easy, I swear. They're all definitely easier than being defenestrated, which is the only alternative I am offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please. Listen, you can email me. I'll help. I don't want to hurt anyone again. ludicity.hackernews@gmail.com. There.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've got an offer of professional help. Do you know why I'm being so generous with my time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's so that I can &lt;em&gt;fucking dropkick&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;em&gt;animals&lt;/em&gt; that don't take it with a clear conscience.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-will-fucking-dropkick-you-if-you-use-that-spreadsheet/</guid></item><item><title>Most Data Work Seems Fundamentally Worthless</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/most-data-work-seems-fundamentally-worthless/</link><description>&lt;h1 id="post-mortem"&gt;Post-mortem&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After going viral, there is one comment I'd like to address. One guy pointed out how comfortable this work seemed, how high the pay was, and said I am out-of-touch and privileged. To that I say, &lt;em&gt;yes, obviously&lt;/em&gt;. I moved to the first-world to have first-world problems. Mission accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a flavor of despair I've become accustomed to, so deeply ingrained in the hearts of myself and my colleagues that it has settled into a hopeless passivity. It's the despair that comes from knowing that we spend most of our time producing nothing of value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is something we admit to quietly, sometimes laughingly, because we know it could be much worse. For the most part, we all work in the data space at large organisations, either in the public sector or adjacent to it. It is an incredibly comfortable living. The pressure is non-existent, we clock out at 5PM, and there are certainly fates far worse than that. But still, we despair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember my first job, fresh out of university, where I was paid &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; enough to say that I was earning six figures, which is a heady experience for a young man from a developing country. At the time, I felt like quite the hotshot, and had a title to back that up - 'data scientist'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did such a position entail? I spent about two years in that role and produced absolutely nothing of value to society, and more strangely, nothing of value to the organisation I was in. I largely produced PowerBI dashboards from awful data sources that I knew no one was looking at - the same people who sent the emails tagged 'URGENT!' and demanded a product ASAP were seemingly unaware that we could view whether anyone actually looked at the work we produced. Sometimes we would have huge errors in the work due to the horrific undocumented database we drew from, and no one would ever notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I wasn't the only person on that team - we had three staff, so we were spending something in the range of $400,000 in payroll and producing no revenue. We frequently went through a rollercoaster of emotions, where we'd strategise and think about how to finally do something interesting and worthwhile, get rebuffed because people actually just wanted their spreadsheets delivered faster, and... despair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This began to wear on me eventually, but I put it down to the first organisation being unusually bad. Eventually, I found a job that should have come with considerably more autonomy at a non-profit. And it was exactly the same. I found myself in a dreary gray office, where many of the staff rather transparently had an intense dislike for the people they were supposed to be helping. The institution produced a fair amount of academic research, but the vast majority of struck me as borderline fraudulent. We had some contracts with industry to produce technology in the space, but these mostly seemed to consist of the organisation fumbling the projects and massaging the truth (read: lying) until they could collect more funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had one more attempt at doing something where I'd try to produce something - anything - working in a unit that assisted emergency services. This time I was a lot more optimistic. The people were extremely intelligent and clearly cared about the mission... but I think anyone that's worked for anything government-adjacent will understand that we never delivered anything. I joined towards the tail-end of a failed cloud migration, was immediately pulled off a project that might do something meaningful to connect spreadsheets to databases, and didn't last long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage I was three-for-three on jobs that did absolutely nothing, and more importantly, I had formed some deep relationships. The funny thing about everyone secretly despairing is that they're usually not too far from forming deep connections the moment you let your own mask slip. The absolutely fucked up thing is that everyone I've met in this space seems to have totally given up on doing anything meaningful at work. The goal is to get paid, not stress out, have a happy office where everyone can collect their strange handout, and not think too deeply about how unfulfilling is it to produce nothing for forty hours a week. As far as lives go, in some ways it's more admirable than the blatant veneration of money. At least human happiness is a major concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've heard from more than one person, and heard myself saying, that the first thing I would do if I was in charge would be to fire myself, as the immediate savings would be the greatest outcome anyone had ever produced in the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I was perplexed. Of course, I was familiar with cynicism around work. It's hardly a novel concept, it permeates the culture, and it was further popularized by the late David Graeber's writing on &lt;em&gt;Bullshit Jobs&lt;/em&gt;. Also, as a rough rule, cynicism makes you &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; clever (and to spare other young people learning this the hard way, it makes you obnoxious to be around when expressed too much), so it was certainly something I had started to affect, but never internalized. How on &lt;em&gt;earth&lt;/em&gt; could we have what seemed to be an entire industry of people who all knew their jobs were pointless?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="talking-about-data-is-signalling"&gt;Talking about data is signalling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I hadn't really grasped was the degree to which some organisations have grown so absurdly fat that they could afford to dispose of millions of dollars on employees who did &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; other than reaffirm a vague commitment to being data driven. The same people that &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; technology affirming language seem to largely be the same people who will insist that everything be delivered in a spreadsheet format. They also can't code - the degree to which my teams sucked was basically directly correlated to how good my manager's people skills were &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; whether they had programming experience. In any case, it's fine to talk about modernization but also demand everything be done the lazy way, because talking about the love of technology signals that everyone involved is modern and willing to endorse any viewpoint beneficial to the organisation, but getting the spreadsheet &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt; means that you can look good for quick delivery. Why not have your cake and eat it too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="terrible-data-makes-doing-anything-good-impossible"&gt;Terrible data makes doing anything good impossible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most organisations seem to have created their data stored as compacted Hell-bricks jammed into a teetering edifice which threatens to crush anyone who so much as breathes near it. It is frequently such a Herculean task to even put together a dataset that represents a clear view of what the organisation is doing that you just can't. That is, the thing you have been hired to do is not possible. But that would mean that you, your colleagues, and almost all those managers should be fired, so we just don't talk about it aloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vision-is-hard"&gt;Vision is hard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most organisations don't have people with the right incentives and vision to push for real change, and only getting part of the formula right seems to lead to no outcome at all. I've seen a machine learning project take several years to come to fruition, but there was no plan to do anything with the model's output, so we have a model and no plan to intervene based on its output. But that doesn't stop management from discussing it like it's a huge success, as per the idea of data talk really being signalling (the secret is not measuring any outcomes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="friction-with-internal-policy"&gt;Friction with internal policy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are usually at least a few tasks required for the organisation to function, such as producing some sort of report for the government, that technically does need to happen, so we can't simply lay everyone off. Frequently it's a task that one competent developer could probably automate forever, were it not for that developer needing a small army to handle the logistics of navigating the bureaucracy of getting one change request passed. My first team asked for an EC2 instance with just enough compute to trigger a bash script using Airflow, and we were quoted $40,000. This is the some section of the organisation's way of saying "fuck off". Getting these requests pushed through requires enough staff that the person asking for them is considered important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one person could do the job, but the organisation forces us to hire more people (and listen, I'm sympathetic - the team telling us to fuck off were themselves in some sort of perpetual gridlock), so that the manager of those people is important enough to enable the one person to do the job. And, you know, it's government reporting. Even when I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; do one of these necessary tasks, it wasn't exactly what I imagined doing with my finite time on this earth, at least when it was my &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; measurable output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="free-money-attracts-conmen"&gt;Free money attracts conmen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piles of money + unclear outcomes = every grifter under the sun begins to migrate to your organisation. It is very hard to keep them all out, and they naturally begin to let other grifters in because they all run interference for each other. Sure, they might betray each other constantly, but they &lt;em&gt;won't&lt;/em&gt; challenge the social fiction that some sort of meaningful work is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="conclusions-right-now"&gt;Conclusions right now&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've punched this all out over one evening, and I'm still figuring things out myself, but here's what I've got so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've realized that applying to jobs expecting this to get better is probably a terrible play. There are almost certainly organisations that don't run this way, but it's not like producing something that isn't literally worthless is sufficient to enjoy spending most of your life doing it. For some people, it's taking care of their families, or they're trapped in the job because they have debt. For others, they really have found something they deeply enjoy. But for many people still on their way to some level of actualization at work, we're going through the process of gradually shedding each layer of dissatisfaction, only to turn up new ones. There's presumably a layer when you're done with this, but I frankly don't feel like I have enough time in my life to hop through these jobs until I find the right fit when I see people in their 40s that haven't managed it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've spoken to consultants who feel successful, but long for meaning. And public sector workers who deeply believe in the mission, but long for actual success. And yes, a few people who are actually deeply happy with their work (but none of them are in I.T thus far).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two people who were most happy? The first was a friend who had worked for the government, and gradually become incredibly disillusioned with their labour after producing nothing for years but continuing to get paid. They eventually quit their incredibly cushy job and sold books for a few months at a big retail chain - and they said it was incredibly therapeutic. They finally felt they were &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; something worthwhile, as simple as it was. That said, they did also say the experience was great only while romanticizing it a bit, and that it probably would have felt very different if they felt trapped in it as a career for years. They're still figuring things out (they've moved from the "this is worthless" layer of the despair lasagna to the "this has worth, but not enough to spends years on" layer), but they're certainly doing better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second was my barber. He's an immigrant here, and started a very successful business. Unlike the young tech entrepreneurs I typically meet (who glorify money and the wealthy in a way I find grotesque), he's a very quiet man who has incredibly happy employees and remembers every customer by name. On an impulse, I asked him why he started his own business when he could easily have earned a good living just working for an existing company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that he hated the feeling of churning work out on an assembly line ($25 per haircut, you'd better get four customers done an hour!), and wanted to replicate the experience he was used to in his home country. He doubled the price and the amount of time he could spend with each customer, and held to the conviction that people would be willing to pay for quality and time, even if it wasn't cheap or expedient. He has three branches up now, and his employees talk about him like he's a father to them. He has carved out a little part of the city where people are taken care of, feel safe, and deliver something they care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, that's what feels right to me - those of us who are despairing, we're chasing quality and meaning, and we can't do it while we're taking orders from people with the wrong vision, the wrong incentives, at dysfunctional organisations, and with data that makes our tasks fundamentally impossible in the first place. Quality takes time, and right now, it definitely feels like there isn't much of a place for that in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/most-data-work-seems-fundamentally-worthless/</guid></item></channel></rss>
