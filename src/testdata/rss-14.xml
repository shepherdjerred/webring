				<title>Dropping hashes: an idiom used to demonstrate provenance of documents</title>
				
				             <dc:creator>Patrick McKenzie (patio11)</dc:creator>
				 

				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;There exists an idiom called “dropping a hash” which is widely understood in the security community and not widely understood elsewhere. Somewhat surprisingly, there does not appear to be a canonical explanation. I have dropped hashes before and wrote this up to explain the significance of it to non-specialists.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Working Group's White paper on Japan and covid-19</title>
				
				             <dc:creator>Patrick McKenzie (patio11)</dc:creator>
				 

				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author’s note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a copy of the white paper of the Working Group, a group of four pseudonymous professionals in Tokyo. I, Patrick McKenzie, was the primary author. It was distributed quietly during the week of March 25th, 2020. I have written &lt;a href="/2020/04/21/japan-coronavirus/"&gt;an essay describing how this document came to be and demonstrating its provenance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				             <dc:creator>Patrick McKenzie (patio11)</dc:creator>

				<title>How Discount Brokerages Make Money</title>
				
				             <dc:creator>Patrick McKenzie (patio11)</dc:creator>
				 

				
					<description>Discount brokerages are accused of making their money via payment for order flow. This is wrong; it is actually mostly net interest revenue. That so dominates their business that selling trades for commissions is irrational; better to give away the trades to attract assets.</description>
